1,"In Natural Language Processing, Feature Extraction is one of the most important steps to be followed for a better understanding of the context of what we are dealing with. After the initial text is cleaned, we need to transform it into its features to be used for modeling. Document data is not computable so it must be transformed into numerical. data such as a vector space model. This transformation task is generally called feature extraction of document data. Feature Extraction is also called Text Representation, Text Extraction, or Text Vectorization. If we have textual data, that data we can not feed to any machine learning algorithm because the Machine Learning algorithm doesn’t understand text data. It understands only numerical data. The process of converting text data into numbers is called Feature Extraction from the text. It is also called text vectorization.

1,"All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.

1,"Artificial neural networks and deep learning AI technologies are quickly evolving, primarily because AI can process large amounts of data much faster and make predictions more accurately than humanly possible.

While the huge volume of data created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications using machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. As of this writing, a primary disadvantage of AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data AI programming requires. As AI techniques are incorporated into more products and services, organizations must also be attuned to AI's potential to create biased and discriminatory systems, intentionally or inadvertently.

1,"Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at Michigan State University, explained that AI can be categorized into four types, beginning with the task-specific intelligent systems in wide use today and progressing to sentient systems, which do not yet exist. The categories are as follows.

Type 1: Reactive machines. These AI systems have no memory and are task-specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on a chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.
Type 2: Limited memory. These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.
Type 3: Theory of mind. Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI systems to become integral members of human teams.
Type 4: Self-awareness. In this category, AI systems have a sense of self, which gives them consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their own current state. This type of AI does not yet exist.",What are the 4 types of artificial intelligence,"Type 1: Reactive Machines - These AI systems lack memory and are designed for specific tasks, exemplified by Deep Blue, the IBM chess program from the 1990s. Although capable of identifying chessboard pieces and making predictions, their lack of memory precludes them from using past experiences for future decision-making.

Type 2: Limited Memory - AI systems of this type possess memory, allowing them to leverage past experiences for future decisions. Examples include decision-making functions in self-driving cars.

Type 3: Theory of Mind - Drawing from psychology, this type implies social intelligence in AI, enabling the system to comprehend emotions, infer human intentions, and predict behavior. This skill is crucial for AI to seamlessly integrate into human teams.

Type 4: Self-awareness - This category envisions AI systems with self-awareness, endowing them with consciousness. Machines possessing self-awareness would understand their current state. It's important to note that AI with this level of self-awareness does not currently exist.","Type 1: Reactive Machines

Think of these like one-trick ponies. They can do one specific job really well, like playing chess (just like Deep Blue did in the '90s), but they can't remember past games or experiences. It's all about the task at hand.
Type 2: Limited Memory

These AI systems are a bit better. They can remember some stuff from the past, so when they're making decisions, they can use what they've learned before. For example, some parts of self-driving cars work this way—they remember past situations to drive better.
Type 3: Theory of Mind

Now, we're getting into AI that understands people a bit more. Think of it like a computer that can ""get"" human feelings. It might predict what you're going to do based on how you're feeling. This is important for AI to work well with humans on teams.
Type 4: Self-awareness

This is like the most advanced level. Imagine AI that not only understands what's happening around it but also knows itself. It's conscious, aware of its own state. But, here's the thing—this kind of AI doesn't exist yet. It's like a futuristic idea for now.",4,5

Type 1: Reactive machines. These AI systems have no memory and are task-specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on a chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.

1,"The ongoing success of applied AI and cognitive simulation, as described in the preceding sections of this article, seems assured. However, artificial general intelligence (AGI), or strong AI—that is, artificial intelligence that aims to duplicate human intellectual abilities—remains controversial and out of reach. Exaggerated claims of success, in professional journals as well as in the popular press, have damaged its reputation. At the present time even an embodied system displaying the overall intelligence of a cockroach is proving elusive, let alone a system that can rival a human being. The difficulty of scaling up AI’s modest achievements cannot be overstated. Decades of research in symbolic AI have failed to produce any firm evidence that a symbol system can manifest human levels of general intelligence; connectionists are unable to model the nervous systems of even the simplest invertebrates; and critics of nouvelle AI regard as simply mystical the view that high-level behaviours involving language understanding, planning, and reasoning will somehow emerge from the interaction of basic behaviours such as obstacle avoidance, gaze control, and object manipulation.

However, this lack of substantial progress may simply be testimony to the difficulty of AGI, not to its impossibility. Let us turn to the very idea of AGI. Can a computer possibly think? Noam Chomsky suggests that debating this question is pointless, for it is an essentially arbitrary decision whether to extend common usage of the word think to include machines. There is, Chomsky claims, no factual question as to whether any such decision is right or wrong—just as there is no question as to whether our decision to say that airplanes fly is right, or our decision not to say that ships swim is wrong. However, this seems to oversimplify matters. The important question is: Could it ever be appropriate to say that computers think and, if so, what conditions must a computer satisfy in order to be so described?

Some authors offer the Turing test as a definition of intelligence. However, Turing himself pointed out that a computer that ought to be described as intelligent might nevertheless fail his test if it were incapable of successfully imitating a human being. For example, ChatGPT continually invokes its status as a large language model and thus would be unlikely to pass the Turing test. If an intelligent entity can fail the test, then the test cannot function as a definition of intelligence. It is even questionable whether passing the test would actually show that a computer is intelligent, as the information theorist Claude Shannon and the AI pioneer John McCarthy pointed out in 1956. Shannon and McCarthy argued that in principle it is possible to design a machine containing a complete set of canned responses to all the questions that an interrogator could possibly ask during the fixed time span of the test. Like Parry, this machine would produce answers to the interviewer’s questions by looking up appropriate responses in a giant table. This objection seems to show that in principle a system with no intelligence at all could pass the Turing test.

In fact, AI has no real definition of intelligence to offer, not even in the subhuman case. Rats are intelligent, but what exactly must an artificial intelligence achieve before researchers can claim that it has reached rats’ level of success? In the absence of a reasonably precise criterion for when an artificial system counts as intelligent, there is no objective way of telling whether an AI research program has succeeded or failed. One result of AI’s failure to produce a satisfactory criterion of intelligence is that, whenever researchers achieve one of AI’s goals—for example, a program that can summarize newspaper articles or beat the world chess champion—critics are able to say, “That’s not intelligence!” Marvin Minsky’s response to the problem of defining intelligence is to maintain—like Turing before him—that intelligence is simply our name for any problem-solving mental process that we do not yet understand.

Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.
Code review: Are an effective means to confirm that new and modified software is following an organization’s coding standards and adheres to its best practices.
Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.
Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.
Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.
Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.
Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.
Security testing: validate that your software is not open to hacker or other malicious types of vulnerabilities that could be exploited to deny access to your services or cause them to perform incorrectly.
Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.

Time and Cost Savings:

Regular testing during development prevents costly and time-consuming issues post-launch, contributing to more efficient software development.","Defects can be identified , Improves quality of software, Increased customer satisfaction, Helps with scalability, Saves time and money",4,5
2,"Benefits of Software Testing
Product quality: Testing ensures the delivery of a high-quality product as the errors are discovered and fixed early in the development cycle.
Customer satisfaction: Software testing aims to detect the errors or vulnerabilities in the software early in the development phase so that the detected bugs can be fixed before the delivery of the product. Usability testing is a type of software testing that checks the application for how easily usable it is for the users to use the application.
Cost-effective: Testing any project on time helps to save money and time for the long term. If the bugs are caught in the early phases of software testing, it costs less to fix those errors.
Security: Security testing is a type of software testing that is focused on testing the application for security vulnerabilities from internal or external sources. ",Give the benefits of Software Testing,"Benefits of Software Testing

2,"Unit tests are typically written by developers as they write the code for a given unit. They are usually written in the same programming language as the software and use a testing framework or library that provides the necessary tools for creating and running the tests. These frameworks often include assertion libraries, which allow developers to write test cases that check the output of a given unit against expected results. The tests are usually run automatically and continuously as part of the software build process, and the results are typically displayed in a test runner or a continuous integration tool.

Unit testing has several benefits, including:

Early detection and isolation of defects, which can save time and money by allowing developers to fix errors before they become more costly to fix.
Improved software quality and maintainability, as unit tests help to ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality.
Increased developer confidence, as developers can make changes to the code with the knowledge that any errors will be caught by the unit tests.
Facilitation of test-driven development, a software development methodology in which tests are written before code is written, ensuring that code is written to meet the requirements.
Overall, Unit testing is an essential part of software development that helps to ensure the quality and reliability of the software, by identifying errors early on in the development process.",Explain Unit Testing,"A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system.

Mainly bug life cycle refers to its entire state starting from a new defect detected to the closing off of that defect by the tester. Alternatively, it is also called a Bug Life Cycle.

The journey of the Defect Cycle varies from organization to organization and also from project to project because development procedures and platforms as well as testing methods and testing tools differ depending upon organizations and projects. 
The number of states that a defect goes through also varies depending upon the different tools used and processes followed during the testing of software.

Usability Testing: Usability testing is done to measure how easy and user-friendly a software application is. 
System Testing: System testing is a type of software testing that is performed on the complete integrated system to evaluate the compliance of the system with the corresponding requirements. 
Regression Testing: Regression testing is done to make sure that the code changes should not affect the existing functionality and the features of the application. It concentrates on whether all parts are working or not.
Sanity Testing: Sanity testing is a subset of regression testing and is done to make sure that the code changes introduced are working as expected.

In this, the test objects can be tested independently as a component without integrating with other components.",List and explain 5 types of Funtional Testing,"1) Unit Testing
i. With this functional testing type ,smallest functional and testable unit of code is tested during unit testing.
ii. Mostly, performed by developers, since it is a White-Box testing technique.

iii. Performed during the earliest stages of development, hence helps in uncovering defects during initial development phases.This helps in saving the higher cost of fixing the defects during the later stages of the STLC.

iv. Techniques used are:

Branch Coverage– All the logical paths and conditions (i.e. True and False), are covered during testing. E.g. for an If-Then-Else statement in the code, all branches of the path are If and Then conditions.
Statement Coverage– All the statements present in the function or module should be traversed at least once during the testing.
Boundary Value Analysis– The test data is created for the boundary values and also for the values that lie just before and just after the boundary value and then the test case is run using all the created datasets. e.g. Days of Month can have valid data from 1 to 31. So, valid boundary values are 1 and 31 but the test case will also be tested for 0 and 32 to test the invalid conditions as well.
Decision Coverage– During execution of Control Structures like “Do-While” or “Case statement” all decision paths are tested.
v. Tools Used for Unit Testing- Junit, Jtest, JMockit, NUnit etc.

2) Integration Testing
i. Two or more unit tested components of the software are integrated together, and tested to validate the interaction between them is as expected.

ii. The communication of commands, data, DB calls, API calls, Micro-services processing is happening between the units and there is no unexpected behaviour observed during this integration.

iii. Types of Integration Testing

Incremental – One or more components are combined and tested, once successfully tested more components are combined and tested. The process continues until the whole system is successfully tested.
There can be three approaches for Incremental Integration Testing:

1. Top-Down Approach: Modules from the top level of either control flow or according to the system design are tested first and the low level of modules are integrated incrementally. If a low-level module is not available, a stub is used.

2. Bottom-Up Approach: Reverse of Top-Down approach, low-level modules are tested first and then high-level modules are added incrementally. If a high-level module is not available, a driver is used.

3. Hybrid Approach: Combination of Top-Down and Bottom-Up approach. Testing starts at both the levels and converges at the middle level.

Big-Bang- All of the components are integrated and tested as a whole system, just like a big bang!
3) Interface Testing
i. A part of integration testing; the correctness of data exchange, data transfer, messages, calls and commands between two integrated components are tested.

ii. Communication between database, web-services, APIs or any external component and the application is tested during Interface Testing.

iii.  There should not be any error or format mismatch during this data or command communication. If any such problem is encountered, that needs to be corrected.

iv. Interface testing is the testing of the communication between different interfaces, while Integration Testing is the testing of the integrated group of modules as a single unit.

4) System Testing
i. All components of the system are combined and the system is tested for compliance and correctness against the requirement specifications (Functional or System).

ii. It is a Black-Box testing technique which validates the integrated system.

iii. It is performed before the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) in STLC(Software Testing Life Cycle).
iv. System Testing is performed in an almost real-life environment and according to real-life usage.

5) Regression Testing
i. After some enhancements or code fixes by developers, it becomes very important to run the regression test suite. Regression is run to ensure that these code changes have not hampered the existing working functionalities or any new defect is not injected in the code.

ii. Regression test cases are the subset of existing Functional Tests, which cover the major functionalities of the system.

iii. Regression cases need to be updated, added and deleted according to the application changes.

iv. The Regression test Cases are the best candidates for automation testing because they are run often and require time for execution.

v. Regression test cases to be run can be selected in 3 ways below:

 Run the whole regression test suite
Select the high priority test cases from regression suite
Select cases from regression suite testing the functionalities related to the code changes. 
Regression Testing is a pretty big concept in itself. To read more in detail about regression testing, please checkout the guide here: Regression Testing: Challenges, Strategies, and Best Practices

If you are at a stage where you find yourself spending too much time in executing the same regression test cases multiple times in a short duration, then you need to start thinking about automation. If you are not sure if you need to take up automation, this article can help : Why Automate Regression Testing in Accelerated Agile Delivery Cycles
6) Smoke Testing
i. After development, when a new build is released, Smoke Testing is performed on the application to ensure that all end-to-end major functionalities work.

ii. Smoke testing is usually done for the builds created during the initial phase of development for an application, which are not yet stable.

iii. During testing, if any major functionality is not working as expected then that particular build is rejected. Developers need to fix the bugs and create a new build for further testing.

iv. After successful Smoke Testing, the application is ready for the next level of testing. 

7) Sanity Testing
i. Sanity Tests are selected from the Regression Test suite, covering major functionalities of the application.

ii. Sanity Testing is done on the new build created by developers for a relatively stable application.

iii. When an application successfully passes the Sanity Testing, it is ready for the next level of testing.

iv. It is easy to be confused between smoke and sanity testing. To test an initial application after a new build, Smoke Testing is performed. After many releases, once it has gained stability, Sanity Testing is performed on the same application.

 Differences between smoke testing, sanity testing and regression testing are mentioned in detail here.
8) Acceptance Testing
i. During Acceptance Testing, the acceptance of the application by the end-user is tested. Aim of this testing is to make sure that the developed system fulfils all the requirements that were agreed upon during the business requirement creation.
ii. It is performed just after the System Testing and before the final release of the application in the real world.

iii. Acceptance testing becomes a criterion for the user to either accept or reject the system.

iv. It is a Black-Box testing technique because we are only interested in knowing the application’s readiness for the market and real users.

v. Types of Acceptance Testing

a) User Acceptance Testing

Alpha Testing- Performed at the developer’s site by skilled testers.
Beta Testing- Performed at the client site by real users.

2,"Performance Testing is a type of software testing that ensures software applications perform properly under their expected workload. It is a testing technique carried out to determine system performance in terms of sensitivity, reactivity, and stability under a particular workload. 

Performance testing is a type of software testing that focuses on evaluating the performance and scalability of a system or application. The goal of performance testing is to identify bottlenecks, measure system performance under various loads and conditions, and ensure that the system can handle the expected number of users or transactions.",Explain PerformanceTesting,"Performance Testing is a type of software testing that ensures software applications perform properly under their expected workload. It is a testing technique carried out to determine system performance in terms of sensitivity, reactivity, and stability under a particular workload. ","Performance testing is a non-functional software testing technique that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of an application holds up under a given workload",4,6
2,"Types of Performance Testing:

Load testing: 
It checks the product’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance congestion before the software product is launched in the market.
Stress testing: 
It involves testing a product under extreme workloads to see whether it handles high traffic or not. The objective is to identify the breaking point of a software product.
Endurance testing: 
It is performed to ensure the software can handle the expected load over a long period.
Spike testing: 
It tests the product’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.
Volume testing: 
In volume testing, large number of data is saved in a database and the overall software system’s behaviour is observed. The objective is to check the product’s performance under varying database volumes.
Scalability testing: 
In scalability testing, the software application’s effectiveness is determined by scaling up to support an increase in user load. It helps in planning capacity additions to your software system.",List and Explain the types of Performance Testing,"Load Testing
Load testing measures system performance as the workload increases. That workload could mean concurrent users or transactions. The system is monitored to measure response time and system staying power as workload increases. That workload falls within the parameters of normal working conditions.

Stress Testing
Unlike load testing, stress testing — also known as fatigue testing — is meant to measure system performance outside of the parameters of normal working conditions. The software is given more users or transactions that can be handled. The goal of stress testing is to measure the software stability. At what point does software fail, and how does the software recover from failure?

Spike Testing
Spike testing is a type of stress testing that evaluates software performance when workloads are substantially increased quickly and repeatedly. The workload is beyond normal expectations for short amounts of time.

Endurance Testing
Endurance testing — also known as soak testing — is an evaluation of how software performs with a normal workload over an extended amount of time. The goal of endurance testing is to check for system problems such as memory leaks. (A memory leak occurs when a system fails to release discarded memory. The memory leak can impair system performance or cause it to fail.)

Scalability Testing
Scalability testing is used to determine if software is effectively handling increasing workloads. This can be determined by gradually adding to the user load or data volume while monitoring system performance. Also, the workload may stay at the same level while resources such as CPUs and memory are changed.

Volume Testing
Volume testing determines how efficiently software performs with large projected amounts of data. It is also known as flood testing because the test floods the system with data.","Load testing – checks the application’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live.
Stress testing – involves testing an application under extreme workloads to see how it handles high traffic or data processing. The objective is to identify the breaking point of an application.
Endurance testing – is done to make sure the software can handle the expected load over a long period of time.
Spike testing – tests the software’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.
Volume testing – Under Volume Testing large no. of. Data is populated in a database, and the overall software system’s behavior is monitored. The objective is to check software application’s performance under varying database volumes.
Scalability testing – The objective of scalability testing is to determine the software application’s effectiveness in “scaling up” to support an increase in user load. It helps plan capacity addition to your software system.",4,5
2,"Features and Functionality supported by a software system are not the only concern. A software application’s performance, like its response time, reliability, resource usage, and scalability, do matter. The goal of Performance Testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks.

Performance Testing is done to provide stakeholders with information about their application regarding speed, stability, and scalability. More importantly, Performance Testing uncovers what needs to be improved before the product goes to market. Without Performance Testing, the software is likely to suffer from issues such as: running slow while several users use it simultaneously, inconsistencies across different operating systems, and poor usability. Performance testing will determine whether their software meets speed, scalability, and stability requirements under expected workloads. Applications sent to market with poor performance metrics due to nonexistent or poor performance testing are likely to gain a bad reputation and fail to meet expected sales goals.",Why do Performance Testing?,"Performance testing helps identify and eliminate performance-related issues early in the development cycle, which reduces the time and cost of fixing them later. This allows developers to focus on other critical tasks, increasing productivity.","imagine you're working on a big school project, and you want to make sure everything runs smoothly. Performance testing is like checking your project as you go along to catch any issues early on. This is super helpful because fixing small problems now is much easier than trying to sort them out right before the project is due.

So, in the world of creating things (like software), performance testing is like making sure everything works well from the start. It's a bit like finding and fixing mistakes in your project so that you have more time to focus on other important stuff, making you more productive",3,5

1,"Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, and its importance can be attributed to several key reasons:

Quality of Input Data:

Machine learning models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Poor-quality data, which may contain errors, missing values, or outliers, can lead to inaccurate and unreliable models. Preprocessing helps in cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for training models.
Handling Missing Values:

Real-world datasets often have missing values due to various reasons such as sensor failures, data corruption, or human errors. Preprocessing involves strategies for handling missing data, such as imputation or removal of affected samples or features.
Dealing with Noisy Data:

Noise in the data can be introduced by outliers or irrelevant information. Outliers can significantly impact the training process and model performance. Data preprocessing techniques help in identifying and handling noisy data to improve the overall robustness of the model.
Normalization and Scaling:

Different features in a dataset may have different scales, and some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of input features. Normalization and scaling techniques (e.g., Min-Max scaling or z-score normalization) ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process, preventing some features from dominating others.
Handling Categorical Data:

Many machine learning algorithms require numerical input, but real-world data often includes categorical variables. Encoding categorical variables into a suitable format, such as one-hot encoding, is part of the preprocessing step.
Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the performance of the model. This process can include operations like polynomial feature expansion, log transformations, or creating interaction terms. Effective feature engineering can uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data.
Dimensionality Reduction:

High-dimensional datasets can suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computation time and overfitting. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be applied during preprocessing to retain essential information while reducing the number of features.
Ensuring Consistency:

Data from various sources may have inconsistencies in terms of format, units, or other properties. Preprocessing helps in standardizing and ensuring the consistency of data, making it compatible for training machine learning models.
Improving Model Performance:

Well-preprocessed data can lead to better model performance. By addressing issues like noise, outliers, and missing values, preprocessing contributes to the creation of more accurate and robust machine learning models.

1,"Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, and its importance can be attributed to several key reasons:

Quality of Input Data:

Machine learning models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Poor-quality data, which may contain errors, missing values, or outliers, can lead to inaccurate and unreliable models. Preprocessing helps in cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for training models.
Handling Missing Values:

Real-world datasets often have missing values due to various reasons such as sensor failures, data corruption, or human errors. Preprocessing involves strategies for handling missing data, such as imputation or removal of affected samples or features.
Dealing with Noisy Data:

Noise in the data can be introduced by outliers or irrelevant information. Outliers can significantly impact the training process and model performance. Data preprocessing techniques help in identifying and handling noisy data to improve the overall robustness of the model.
Normalization and Scaling:

Different features in a dataset may have different scales, and some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of input features. Normalization and scaling techniques (e.g., Min-Max scaling or z-score normalization) ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process, preventing some features from dominating others.
Handling Categorical Data:

Many machine learning algorithms require numerical input, but real-world data often includes categorical variables. Encoding categorical variables into a suitable format, such as one-hot encoding, is part of the preprocessing step.
Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the performance of the model. This process can include operations like polynomial feature expansion, log transformations, or creating interaction terms. Effective feature engineering can uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data.
Dimensionality Reduction:

High-dimensional datasets can suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computation time and overfitting. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be applied during preprocessing to retain essential information while reducing the number of features.
Ensuring Consistency:

Data from various sources may have inconsistencies in terms of format, units, or other properties. Preprocessing helps in standardizing and ensuring the consistency of data, making it compatible for training machine learning models.

6. Keras Tuner
Keras Tuner is a library that helps you pick the optimal set of hyperparameters for your TensorFlow program. When you build a model for hyperparameter tuning, you also define the hyperparameter search space in addition to the model architecture. The model you set up for hyperparameter tuning is called a hypermodel.
You can define a hypermodel through two approaches:
•	By using a model builder function
•	By subclassing the HyperModel class of the Keras Tuner API
7. Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian Optimization is a package designed to minimize the number of steps required to find a combination of parameters that are close to the optimal combination. 
This method uses a proxy optimization problem (finding the maximum of the acquisition function) which, although it’s still a hard problem, it’s cheaper in the computational sense, and common tools can be employed. Therefore, Bayesian Optimization is most adequate for situations where sampling the function to be optimized is a very expensive endeavor.  1. The Bayesian-Optimization Library
The bayesian-optimization library takes black box functions and: 


Optimizes them by creating a Gaussian process 
Balances the exploration in the search space, as well as the exploitation of results obtained from previous iterations. 
Allows you to dynamically pan and zoom the bounds of the problem to improve convergence. 
8. Metric Optimization Engine
MOE (Metric Optimization Engine) is an efficient way to optimize a system’s parameters when evaluating parameters is time-consuming or expensive.
It is ideal for problems in which 
•	the optimization problem’s objective function is a black box, not necessarily convex or concave, 
•	derivatives are unavailable, 
•	and we seek a global optimum, rather than just a local one. 
This ability to handle black-box objective functions allows us to use MOE to optimize nearly any system, without requiring any internal knowledge or access. 
9. Spearmint
Spearmint is a software package that also performs Bayesian optimization. The software is designed to automatically run experiments (thus the code name spearmint) in a manner that iteratively adjusts a number of parameters so as to minimize some objectives in as few runs as possible. 
10. GPyOpt
GPyOpt is Gaussian process optimization using GPy. It performs global optimization with different acquisition functions. 
Among other functionalities, it is possible to use GPyOpt to optimize physical experiments (sequentially or in batches) and tune the parameters of Machine Learning algorithms. It is able to handle large data sets via sparse Gaussian process models.
11. SigOpt
SigOpt fully integrates automated hyperparameter tuning with training runs tracking to give you a sense of the bigger picture and the path to reach your best model. 
With features like highly customizable search spaces and multimetric optimization, SigOpt can advance your model with a simple API for sophisticated hyperparameter tuning before taking it into production.
12. Fabolas
While traditional Bayesian hyperparameter optimizers model the loss of machine learning algorithms on a given dataset as a black box function to be minimized, FAst Bayesian Optimization on LArge data Sets (FABOLAS) models loss and computational cost across dataset size and uses these models to carry out Bayesian optimization with an extra degree of freedom. ",List TEN Tools for hyperparameter optimization and explain any FIVE,"Some of the best hyperparameter optimization libraries are:

Scikit-learn has implementations for grid search and random search and is a good place to start if you are building models with sklearn. 
For both of those methods, scikit-learn trains and evaluates a model in a k fold cross-validation setting over various parameter choices and returns the best model. 
Specifically:
•	Random search: with randomsearchcv runs the search over some number of random parameter combinations 
•	Grid search: gridsearchcv runs the search over all parameter sets in the grid
Tuning models with scikit-learn is a good start but there are better options out there and they often have random search strategies anyway. 
2. Scikit-optimize
Scikit-optimize uses a Sequential model-based optimization algorithm to find optimal solutions for hyperparameter search problems in less time.
Scikit-optimize provides many features other than hyperparameter optimization such as: 
•	store and load optimization results,
•	convergence plots, 
•	comparing surrogate models
3. Optuna
Optuna uses a historical record of trails details to determine the promising area to search for optimizing the hyperparameter and hence finds the optimal hyperparameter in a minimum amount of time. 
It has the pruning feature which automatically stops the unpromising trails in the early stages of training. Some of the key features provided by optuna are:
•	Lightweight, versatile, and platform-agnostic architecture
•	Pythonic search spaces
•	Efficient optimization algorithms
•	Easy parallelization
•	Quick visualization

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics that poses a hypothetical scenario in which a person is required to make a choice between two negative outcomes.
Using the four paradigms to solve the problem:
•	Think Humanly
When thinking humanly the Artificial Intelligence tried to understand and model how the human mind works, it tries to emulate activities that are associate to human thinking, activities such as decision making, problem solving, learning. Etc.
If we are going to say that a given program thinks like human, we must have some way of determining how humans think. We need to go inside the actual workings of human minds.
	In the question, we are presented with a scenario similar to the trolley problem, it has to make the decision of whether to go on path A which has the baby on it, or go through path B with the elderly woman. If the machine was to think humanly, it would hit the old woman and save the baby or come to an halt to save both the baby and the old woman.
•	Think Rationally

1,"1. Neural Network (NN)
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.
Neural Network can be used to approximate non-linear systems which makes it evidence based. Also, because it can approximate non-linear system, it can be applied to a lot of environment application because they are non-linear. Neural Network can be used for regression and classification but mostly for regression, meaning it can be used to estimate an unknown parameter from data already known.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection. It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime to solve. It is frequently used to solve optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
Features of Genetic Algorithm
1.	Does not require any derivative information (which may not be available for many real-world problems).
2.	Is faster and more efficient as compared to the neural network.
3.	Has very good parallel capabilities.
4.	Optimizes both continuous and discrete functions and also multi-objective problems.
5.	Provides a list of “good” solutions and not just a single solution.
6.	Always gets an answer to the problem, which gets better over the time.
7.	Useful when the search space is very large and there are a large number of parameters involved.

Applications of Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm has many applications in real world.
1.	Optimization: Genetic Algorithms are most commonly used in optimization problems wherein we have to maximize or minimize a given objective function value under a given set of constraints. 
2.	Economics: GA is also used to characterize various economic models like the cobweb model, game theory equilibrium resolution, asset pricing, etc.
3.	Neural Networks: GA is also used to train neural networks, particularly recurrent neural networks.
4.	Parallelization: GAs also have very good parallel capabilities, and prove to be very effective means in solving certain problems, and also provide a good area for research.
5.	Image Processing: GA is used for various digital image processing (DIP) tasks as well like dense pixel matching.
6.	Vehicle Routing Problems: With multiple soft time windows, multiple depots and a heterogeneous fleet.
7.	Scheduling Applications: GA is used to solve various scheduling problems as well, particularly the time tabling problem.
8.	Machine Learning: as already discussed, genetics-based machine learning (GBML) is a niche area in machine learning.
9.	Robot Trajectory Generation: GA have been used to plan the path which a robot arm takes by moving from one point to another.
10.	Parametric Design of Aircraft: GA have been used to design aircrafts by varying the parameters and evolving better solutions.

3. Decision Tree
Decision tree is supervised learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly this is ideally for solving Classification problems. It is a tree structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In decision tree, there are two modes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision Nodes are used for making any decision and have numerous branches, whereas Leaf Nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree
1.	It has three parts which are the nodes, edges and leaves.
2.	It is non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
3.	It classifies examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, with the leaf node providing the classification to the example.
4.	One of the basic algorithms used in decision tree is ID3
5.	SCIKIT-LEARN library is used to build decision learning model
Applications of Decision Tree:
1.	Face Recognition: Face recognition finds its applications in our smartphones and any other place with Biometric security. Face Recognition is nothing but face detection followed by classification. The classification algorithm determines if the face in the image matches with the registered user or not.
2.	Medical Image Classification: Given the data of patients, a model that is well trained is often used to classify if the patient has a malignant tumor (cancer), heart ailments, fractures, etc.
3.	Stock Market Prediction: Regression algorithms are used to predict the future price of stocks based on certain past features like time of the day or festival time, etc. Stock Market Prediction also falls under a subdomain of study called Time Series Analysis.
4.	Object Detection Algorithms: Object Detection is the process of detection of the location of a given object in an image or video. This process returns the coordinates of the pixel values stating the location of the object in the image. These coordinates are determined by using regression algorithms alongside classification.

Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). Example: Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. . (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. More input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.

2. Genetic Algorithm (GA) 
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection. It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime to solve. It is frequently used to solve optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
Features of Genetic Algorithm
1.	Does not require any derivative information (which may not be available for many real-world problems).
2.	Is faster and more efficient as compared to the neural network.
3.	Has very good parallel capabilities.
4.	Optimizes both continuous and discrete functions and also multi-objective problems.
5.	Provides a list of “good” solutions and not just a single solution.
6.	Always gets an answer to the problem, which gets better over the time.
7.	Useful when the search space is very large and there are a large number of parameters involved.

Applications of Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm has many applications in real world.
1.	Optimization: Genetic Algorithms are most commonly used in optimization problems wherein we have to maximize or minimize a given objective function value under a given set of constraints. 
2.	Economics: GA is also used to characterize various economic models like the cobweb model, game theory equilibrium resolution, asset pricing, etc.
3.	Neural Networks: GA is also used to train neural networks, particularly recurrent neural networks.
4.	Parallelization: GAs also have very good parallel capabilities, and prove to be very effective means in solving certain problems, and also provide a good area for research.
5.	Image Processing: GA is used for various digital image processing (DIP) tasks as well like dense pixel matching.
6.	Vehicle Routing Problems: With multiple soft time windows, multiple depots and a heterogeneous fleet.
7.	Scheduling Applications: GA is used to solve various scheduling problems as well, particularly the time tabling problem.
8.	Machine Learning: as already discussed, genetics-based machine learning (GBML) is a niche area in machine learning.
9.	Robot Trajectory Generation: GA have been used to plan the path which a robot arm takes by moving from one point to another.
10.	Parametric Design of Aircraft: GA have been used to design aircrafts by varying the parameters and evolving better solutions.

3. Decision Tree
Decision tree is supervised learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly this is ideally for solving Classification problems. It is a tree structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In decision tree, there are two modes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision Nodes are used for making any decision and have numerous branches, whereas Leaf Nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree
1.	It has three parts which are the nodes, edges and leaves.
2.	It is non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
3.	It classifies examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, with the leaf node providing the classification to the example.
4.	One of the basic algorithms used in decision tree is ID3
5.	SCIKIT-LEARN library is used to build decision learning model
Applications of Decision Tree:
1.	Face Recognition: Face recognition finds its applications in our smartphones and any other place with Biometric security. Face Recognition is nothing but face detection followed by classification. The classification algorithm determines if the face in the image matches with the registered user or not.
2.	Medical Image Classification: Given the data of patients, a model that is well trained is often used to classify if the patient has a malignant tumor (cancer), heart ailments, fractures, etc.
3.	Stock Market Prediction: Regression algorithms are used to predict the future price of stocks based on certain past features like time of the day or festival time, etc. Stock Market Prediction also falls under a subdomain of study called Time Series Analysis.
4.	Object Detection Algorithms: Object Detection is the process of detection of the location of a given object in an image or video. This process returns the coordinates of the pixel values stating the location of the object in the image. These coordinates are determined by using regression algorithms alongside classification.

SOLUTION
Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). Example: Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. . (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. More input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.

Definition:
Classification is a supervised learning task in machine learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of instances based on their features.

Example:
Consider a spam email classifier. The task is to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). The features could include the presence of certain keywords, the sender's address, and other attributes. The algorithm learns from labeled examples to predict the class label of new, unseen emails.

Regression:
Definition:
Regression is also a supervised learning task, but instead of predicting categorical labels, it aims to predict continuous numerical values.

Example:
Suppose you are building a house price prediction model. The goal is to predict the price of a house based on features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc. The algorithm learns from historical data with known house prices to make predictions for new houses.

Dimensionality Reduction:
Definition:
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving its essential information. It is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with a large number of features, as it can improve computational efficiency and reduce the risk of overfitting.

Example:
Consider a dataset with numerous features describing a person, including age, income, education level, and more. Using dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), you can transform these features into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables while retaining the most important information. This reduced set of features can simplify analysis and modeling.",4,4

Here are some justifications for the limitations of expert systems:

Limited to Explicit Knowledge:

Expert systems rely on explicitly coded knowledge provided by human experts. They may struggle with knowledge that is tacit or hard to articulate, which is common in certain domains where intuition and experience play a significant role.
Lack of Common Sense Reasoning:

Expert systems often lack common sense reasoning abilities that humans naturally possess. They may not perform well in situations where implicit knowledge or contextual understanding is crucial.
Difficulty Handling Uncertainty:

Expert systems may struggle with uncertain or ambiguous information. Real-world scenarios often involve incomplete or imprecise data, and expert systems may not effectively handle uncertainty in decision-making.",4,4

Interactive analytical systems can be used for the assessment of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In order to contextualize, externalize and interpret the knowledge, there is a need to address eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and eXplainable Cognitive Intelligence (XCI). Examples of interactive AI are chatbots and smart personal assistants. Interactive AI is a type of AI in modern business that allows automation of communication without interactivity compromise. Smart personal assistants and Chatbots are used to visualize interactive AI because they have capacities that can vary from replying pre-built questions to understanding the conversation framework. Interactive AI can also be used in improving a company’s interior procedures. The Figure below shows the various types of artificial intelligence.
2. Functional Artificial intelligence (FAI)
Functional AI is very similar to analytic AI.  Enormous quantities of data are needed for scanning and locating patterns as well as dependencies. However, functional AI jumps into action instead of giving references. For instance, functional AI can identify a machine-breakdown patterns in the device data received from a confident machine and a command is generated to turn off this machine because of being the part of the IoT cloud.  Another example: robots being used by Amazon to bring the tables with the items on it to the pickers, during this process the picking process is being speed up. Functional AI can also improve a company’s interior procedures. For example, creation of chatbot to facilitate the corporate process of vacation booking.
3. Analytic Artificial Intelligence (AAI)
It is a type of AI that is motorised with machine learning (including its most innovative unrestricted learning systems), analytic AI scans loads of data for dependences and outlines to finally produce references or provide a business with visions, thus contributing to data-driven decision-making. Dealer Risk Assessment and Sentiment Study are the example of analytic AI in action. 
4. Text Artificial Intelligence (TAI)
Examples of text AI that can be enjoy by businesses using it are speech-to-text conversion, content generation capabilities, text recognition and machine translation. Text powered by AI can find the document containing the most appropriate answer even if the document doesn’t have full keywords contrary to a traditional knowledge-base that rests upon a search by keywords. AI is permitted to build semantic maps by keywords and identify synonyms to appreciate the framework of the user’s questions through the help of ordinary language dispensation and semantic search.

5. Visual Artificial Intelligence (VAI)
visual AI enables, businesses to classify, identify, categorize and categorise objects or change videos and images into visions. Examples of visual AI is a computer system that enables a guarantor to evaluate damage based on damaged machine car or a photo that grades apples based on their size and colour. This type of AI covers augmented reality or computer vision fields.

1,"Model:

A model is a representation or abstraction of a real-world system, process, or phenomenon. In the context of machine learning, a model is a mathematical or computational representation that captures patterns, relationships, or behaviors present in data. Models are trained on data to learn these patterns and can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. Models can take various forms, including linear models, decision trees, neural networks, and more.

Algorithm:

An algorithm, on the other hand, is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules for solving a particular problem or performing a specific task. In the context of machine learning, an algorithm refers to the process or method used to train a model. It defines how the model learns from the training data, adjusts its parameters, and generalizes to make predictions on new data. Algorithms are the underlying procedures that guide the learning process and determine how a model is trained and updated.
",Distinguish between a Model and an Algorithm,"A “model” in machine learning is the output of a machine learning algorithm run on data.
A model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm.
The model is the “thing” that is saved after running a machine learning algorithm on training data and represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures required to make predictions   

While

An “algorithm” in machine learning is a procedure that is run on data to create a machine learning “model.”
Machine learning algorithms perform “pattern recognition.” Algorithms “learn” from data, or are “fit” on a dataset.	
Specifically, an algorithm is run on data to create a model.

3,"Cost estimation models are some mathematical algorithms or parametric equations that are used to estimate the cost of a product or a project. Various techniques or models are available for cost estimation, also known as Cost Estimation Models as shown below: Empirical Estimation Technique – Empirical estimation is a technique or model in which empirically derived formulas are used for predicting the data that are a required and essential part of the software project planning step. These techniques are usually based on the data that is collected previously from a project and also based on some guesses, prior experience with the development of similar types of projects, and assumptions. It uses the size of the software to estimate the effort. In this technique, an educated guess of project parameters is made. Hence, these models are based on common sense. However, as there are many activities involved in empirical estimation techniques, this technique is formalized. For example Delphi technique and Expert Judgement technique.
Heuristic Technique – Heuristic word is derived from a Greek word that means “to discover”. The heuristic technique is a technique or model that is used for solving problems, learning, or discovery in the practical methods which are used for achieving immediate goals. These techniques are flexible and simple for taking quick decisions through shortcuts and good enough calculations, most probably when working with complex data. But the decisions that are made using this technique are necessary to be optimal. In this technique, the relationship among different project parameters is expressed using mathematical equations. The popular heuristic technique is given by Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO). This technique is also used to increase or speed up the analysis and investment decisions.
Analytical Estimation Technique – Analytical estimation is a type of technique that is used to measure work. In this technique, firstly the task is divided or broken down into its basic component operations or elements for analyzing. Second, if the standard time is available from some other source, then these sources are applied to each element or component of work. Third, if there is no such time available, then the work is estimated based on the experience of the work. In this technique, results are derived by making certain basic assumptions about the project. Hence, the analytical estimation technique has some scientific basis. Halstead’s software science is based on an analytical estimation model.
Other Cost Estimation Models are:
Function Point Analysis (FPA): This technique counts the number and complexity of functions that a piece of software can perform to determine how functional and sophisticated it is. The effort needed for development, testing and maintenance can be estimated using this model.
Putnam Model: This model is a parametric estimation model that estimates effort, time and faults by taking into account the size of the the programme, the expertise of the development team and other project-specific characteristics.
Price-to-Win Estimation: Often utilized in competitive bidding, this model is concerned with projecting the expenses associated with developing a particular software project in order to secure a contract. It involves looking at market dynamics and competitors.
Models Based on Machine Learning: Custom cost estimating models can be built using machine learning techniques including neural networks, regression analysis and decision trees. These models are based on past project data. These models are flexible enough to adjust to changing data and project-specific features.

Features explanation
Object Oriented
Ruby is purely object-oriented programming language. Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. Every code has their properties and actions. Ruby is influenced with Smalltalk language. Rules applying to objects applies to the entire Ruby.

Flexibility
Ruby is a flexible language as you can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish.

Mixins
Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.

Dynamic typing and Duck typing
Ruby is a dynamic programming language. Ruby programs are not compiled. All class, module and method definition are built by the code when it run.

Ruby variables are loosely typed language, which means any variable can hold any type of object. When a method is called on an object, Ruby only looks up at the name irrespective of the type of object. This is duck typing. It allows you to make classes that pretend to be other classes.

Variable constants
In Ruby, constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.",List FIVE features of Ruby language and explain any THREE,"Ruby Features:

?	Safe — the obvious way of writing a code is in a safe manner. It is important the developer’s mistake must be caught before the software goes in production. Going with safety Swift might feel a bit strict, but in the long run clarity saves a lot of time.
?	Fast — Swift is meant as a replacement for languages based on C (C++, Objective c and C). Swift’s performance is comparable to these languages in most tasks. The performance also has to be consistent and predictable, not just for short bursts that would require a a lot of work later on.
?	Expressive-Swift offers a syntax that is easy to use and has the features that most developers expect. Even now the languages advancements are being are being monitored, which means that swift is continuously evolving.","?	Safe

4,"Features of C++
1.	Multi-paradigm language: It supports at least 7 different styles of programming
2.	General Purpose languages: It is used in developing, game, desktop, apps, operating systems etc.
3.	Speed: Performance is exceptional.
4.	Object-Oriented: It allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.
5.	Machine Independent: It is machine independent (it can be written on any operating system) but platform dependent (compiled on one operating system won’t run on another).
6.	Compiler-based: That is, C++ programs used to be compiled and their executed file is used to run it.
7.	Case sensitive
8.	Dynamic Memory Allocation: it allows us to allocate the memory of a variable or an array in run-time.
9.	Multithreading: it doesn’t contain any built-in support for multithreading applications, instead it relies entirely upon the os to supply this feature
10.	Mid-level programming languge: it is a programming languge that collects special features of high and low level language
11.	Rich Library: its library is full of in-built functions that save a huge amount of time in the software development phase. Hence, saves programming time and increase development speed.
12.	Recursion: Due to code reusability features, functions can be called within a function saving memory space by not rewriting codes.
Areas of applications
i.	Games: C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU intensive functions and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking. All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop the gaming systems as well as game development suites.
ii.	GUI Based application: C++ is used in developing desktop/GUI application e.g. Adobe, etc.
iii.	Database software: C++ is also used in written Database Management systems e.g. MySQL server
iv.	Operating System: C++ as a middle level language can be send in written an operating system, also because it is a strongly typed and fast programming language, it is ideal candidate for writing operating system.  e.g. Window OS, Linux OS
v.	Browser: Most browsers are written in C++ due to its fast performance e.g. Mozilla, Chrome, Tor etc.
vi.	Advanced Computation and graphics: C++ is useful in developing an application that requires high-performance image processing, real-time physical simulations, and mobile sensor applications that need high performance and speed. e.g. alias system
vii.	Banking Application: for banking applications that require multi-threading, concurrency, and high performance, C++ has been the best language due to it great performance. e.g. Infosys Finacle.
viii.	Cloud/Distributed system: C++ becomes a default choice for implementing such systems as it is close to the hardware and also provides multithreading support that can build concurrent applications and load tolerance.
ix.	Compilers: Compilers of various high-level programming languages are written in C++ because C++ is a middle-level language that is close to hardware and is able to program and manipulate the underlying hardware resources.
x.	Embedded system: Various embedded systems like smartwatches, medical equipment systems use C++ to program as it is closer to the hardware level and can provide a lot of low-level function calls when compared to the other high-level programming languages

Type 1: Reactive machines. These AI systems have no memory and are task-specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on a chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.
Type 2: Limited memory. These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.
Type 3: Theory of mind. Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI systems to become integral members of human teams.

1,"The ongoing success of applied AI and cognitive simulation, as described in the preceding sections of this article, seems assured. However, artificial general intelligence (AGI), or strong AI—that is, artificial intelligence that aims to duplicate human intellectual abilities—remains controversial and out of reach. Exaggerated claims of success, in professional journals as well as in the popular press, have damaged its reputation. At the present time even an embodied system displaying the overall intelligence of a cockroach is proving elusive, let alone a system that can rival a human being. The difficulty of scaling up AI’s modest achievements cannot be overstated. Decades of research in symbolic AI have failed to produce any firm evidence that a symbol system can manifest human levels of general intelligence; connectionists are unable to model the nervous systems of even the simplest invertebrates; and critics of nouvelle AI regard as simply mystical the view that high-level behaviours involving language understanding, planning, and reasoning will somehow emerge from the interaction of basic behaviours such as obstacle avoidance, gaze control, and object manipulation.

However, this lack of substantial progress may simply be testimony to the difficulty of AGI, not to its impossibility. Let us turn to the very idea of AGI. Can a computer possibly think? Noam Chomsky suggests that debating this question is pointless, for it is an essentially arbitrary decision whether to extend common usage of the word think to include machines. There is, Chomsky claims, no factual question as to whether any such decision is right or wrong—just as there is no question as to whether our decision to say that airplanes fly is right, or our decision not to say that ships swim is wrong. However, this seems to oversimplify matters. The important question is: Could it ever be appropriate to say that computers think and, if so, what conditions must a computer satisfy in order to be so described?

Some authors offer the Turing test as a definition of intelligence. However, Turing himself pointed out that a computer that ought to be described as intelligent might nevertheless fail his test if it were incapable of successfully imitating a human being.

Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.
Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.
Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.
Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.
Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.
Security testing: validate that your software is not open to hacker or other malicious types of vulnerabilities that could be exploited to deny access to your services or cause them to perform incorrectly.

2,"Unit tests are typically written by developers as they write the code for a given unit. They are usually written in the same programming language as the software and use a testing framework or library that provides the necessary tools for creating and running the tests. These frameworks often include assertion libraries, which allow developers to write test cases that check the output of a given unit against expected results. The tests are usually run automatically and continuously as part of the software build process, and the results are typically displayed in a test runner or a continuous integration tool.

Unit testing has several benefits, including:

Early detection and isolation of defects, which can save time and money by allowing developers to fix errors before they become more costly to fix.
Improved software quality and maintainability, as unit tests help to ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality.
Increased developer confidence, as developers can make changes to the code with the knowledge that any errors will be caught by the unit tests.
Facilitation of test-driven development, a software development methodology in which tests are written before code is written, ensuring that code is written to meet the requirements.

Suppose there is a software to be tested which has 20 inputs and 20 possible settings for each input so in that case there are total 20^20 possible inputs to be tested. Therefore in this case, exhaustive testing is impossible even all combinations are tried to be tested.",Explain Pairwise Software Testing,"Pairwise testing is a P&C based method, in which to test a system or an application, for each pair of input parameters of a system, all possible discrete combinations of the parameters are tested.

2,"Type of Functional Testing Techniques
Unit Testing: Unit testing is the type of functional testing technique where the individual units or modules of the application are tested. It ensures that each module is working correctly. 
Integration Testing: In Integration testing, combined individual units are tested as a group and expose the faults in the interaction between the integrated units.
Smoke Testing: Smoke testing is a type of functional testing technique where the basic functionality or feature of the application is tested as it ensures that the most important function works properly. 
User Acceptance Testing: User acceptance testing is done by the client to certify that the system meets the requirements and works as intended. It is the final phase of testing before the product release.
Interface Testing: Interface testing is a type of software testing technique that checks the proper interaction between two different software systems.
Usability Testing: Usability testing is done to measure how easy and user-friendly a software application is. 
System Testing: System testing is a type of software testing that is performed on the complete integrated system to evaluate the compliance of the system with the corresponding requirements. 
Regression Testing: Regression testing is done to make sure that the code changes should not affect the existing functionality and the features of the application. It concentrates on whether all parts are working or not.
Sanity Testing: Sanity testing is a subset of regression testing and is done to make sure that the code changes introduced are working as expected. 
White box Testing: White box testing is a type of software testing that allows the tester to verify the internal workings of the software system. This includes analyzing the code, infrastructure, and integrations with the external system.
Black box Testing: Black box testing is a type of software testing where the functionality of the software system is tested without looking at the internal working or structures of the software system.
Database Testing: Database testing is a type of software testing that checks the schema, tables, etc of the database under test.
Adhoc Testing: Adhoc testing also known as monkey testing or random testing is a type of software testing that does not follow any documentation or test plan to perform testing.
Recovery Testing: Recovery testing is a type of software testing that verifies the software’s ability to recover from the failures like hardware failures, software failures, crashes, etc.
Static Testing: Static testing is a type of software testing which is performed to check the defects in software without actually executing the code of the software application.
Greybox Testing: Grey box testing is a type of software testing that includes black box and white box testing.
Component Testing: Component testing also known as program testing or module testing is a type of software testing that is done after the unit testing. In this, the test objects can be tested independently as a component without integrating with other components.",List and explain 5 types of Funtional Testing,"1) Unit Testing
i. With this functional testing type ,smallest functional and testable unit of code is tested during unit testing.
ii. Mostly, performed by developers, since it is a White-Box testing technique.

iii. Performed during the earliest stages of development, hence helps in uncovering defects during initial development phases.This helps in saving the higher cost of fixing the defects during the later stages of the STLC.

iv. Techniques used are:

Branch Coverage– All the logical paths and conditions (i.e. True and False), are covered during testing. E.g. for an If-Then-Else statement in the code, all branches of the path are If and Then conditions.
Statement Coverage– All the statements present in the function or module should be traversed at least once during the testing.
Boundary Value Analysis– The test data is created for the boundary values and also for the values that lie just before and just after the boundary value and then the test case is run using all the created datasets. e.g. Days of Month can have valid data from 1 to 31. So, valid boundary values are 1 and 31 but the test case will also be tested for 0 and 32 to test the invalid conditions as well.
Decision Coverage– During execution of Control Structures like “Do-While” or “Case statement” all decision paths are tested.
v. Tools Used for Unit Testing- Junit, Jtest, JMockit, NUnit etc.

2) Integration Testing
i. Two or more unit tested components of the software are integrated together, and tested to validate the interaction between them is as expected.

ii. The communication of commands, data, DB calls, API calls, Micro-services processing is happening between the units and there is no unexpected behaviour observed during this integration.

iii. Types of Integration Testing

Incremental – One or more components are combined and tested, once successfully tested more components are combined and tested. The process continues until the whole system is successfully tested.
There can be three approaches for Incremental Integration Testing:

1. Top-Down Approach: Modules from the top level of either control flow or according to the system design are tested first and the low level of modules are integrated incrementally. If a low-level module is not available, a stub is used.

2. Bottom-Up Approach: Reverse of Top-Down approach, low-level modules are tested first and then high-level modules are added incrementally. If a high-level module is not available, a driver is used.

3. Hybrid Approach: Combination of Top-Down and Bottom-Up approach. Testing starts at both the levels and converges at the middle level.

Big-Bang- All of the components are integrated and tested as a whole system, just like a big bang!
3) Interface Testing
i. A part of integration testing; the correctness of data exchange, data transfer, messages, calls and commands between two integrated components are tested.

ii. Communication between database, web-services, APIs or any external component and the application is tested during Interface Testing.

iii.  There should not be any error or format mismatch during this data or command communication. If any such problem is encountered, that needs to be corrected.

iv. Interface testing is the testing of the communication between different interfaces, while Integration Testing is the testing of the integrated group of modules as a single unit.

4) System Testing
i. All components of the system are combined and the system is tested for compliance and correctness against the requirement specifications (Functional or System).

ii. It is a Black-Box testing technique which validates the integrated system.

iii. It is performed before the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) in STLC(Software Testing Life Cycle).
iv. System Testing is performed in an almost real-life environment and according to real-life usage.

5) Regression Testing
i. After some enhancements or code fixes by developers, it becomes very important to run the regression test suite. Regression is run to ensure that these code changes have not hampered the existing working functionalities or any new defect is not injected in the code.

ii. Regression test cases are the subset of existing Functional Tests, which cover the major functionalities of the system.

iii. Regression cases need to be updated, added and deleted according to the application changes.

iv. The Regression test Cases are the best candidates for automation testing because they are run often and require time for execution.

v. Regression test cases to be run can be selected in 3 ways below:

 Run the whole regression test suite
Select the high priority test cases from regression suite
Select cases from regression suite testing the functionalities related to the code changes. 
Regression Testing is a pretty big concept in itself. To read more in detail about regression testing, please checkout the guide here: Regression Testing: Challenges, Strategies, and Best Practices

If you are at a stage where you find yourself spending too much time in executing the same regression test cases multiple times in a short duration, then you need to start thinking about automation. If you are not sure if you need to take up automation, this article can help : Why Automate Regression Testing in Accelerated Agile Delivery Cycles
6) Smoke Testing
i. After development, when a new build is released, Smoke Testing is performed on the application to ensure that all end-to-end major functionalities work.

ii. Smoke testing is usually done for the builds created during the initial phase of development for an application, which are not yet stable.

iii. During testing, if any major functionality is not working as expected then that particular build is rejected. Developers need to fix the bugs and create a new build for further testing.

iv. After successful Smoke Testing, the application is ready for the next level of testing. 

7) Sanity Testing
i. Sanity Tests are selected from the Regression Test suite, covering major functionalities of the application.

ii. Sanity Testing is done on the new build created by developers for a relatively stable application.

iii. When an application successfully passes the Sanity Testing, it is ready for the next level of testing.

iv. It is easy to be confused between smoke and sanity testing. To test an initial application after a new build, Smoke Testing is performed. After many releases, once it has gained stability, Sanity Testing is performed on the same application.

 Differences between smoke testing, sanity testing and regression testing are mentioned in detail here.
8) Acceptance Testing
i. During Acceptance Testing, the acceptance of the application by the end-user is tested. Aim of this testing is to make sure that the developed system fulfils all the requirements that were agreed upon during the business requirement creation.
ii. It is performed just after the System Testing and before the final release of the application in the real world.

iii. Acceptance testing becomes a criterion for the user to either accept or reject the system.

iv. It is a Black-Box testing technique because we are only interested in knowing the application’s readiness for the market and real users.

v. Types of Acceptance Testing

a) User Acceptance Testing

Alpha Testing- Performed at the developer’s site by skilled testers.
Beta Testing- Performed at the client site by real users.
b) Business Acceptance Testing

Business Acceptance Testing is done to ensure that the application is able to meet business requirements and goals.

c) Regulation Acceptance Testing

Regulation Acceptance Testing is done to ensure that the developed application does not violate any legal regulations put in place by the governing bodies.

2,"Types of Performance Testing:

Load testing: 
It checks the product’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance congestion before the software product is launched in the market.

Endurance testing: 
It is performed to ensure the software can handle the expected load over a long period.
Spike testing:

Volume testing: 
In volume testing, large number of data is saved in a database and the overall software system’s behaviour is observed. The objective is to check the product’s performance under varying database volumes.
Scalability testing: 
In scalability testing, the software application’s effectiveness is determined by scaling up to support an increase in user load. It helps in planning capacity additions to your software system.",List and Explain the types of Performance Testing,"Load Testing
Load testing measures system performance as the workload increases. That workload could mean concurrent users or transactions. The system is monitored to measure response time and system staying power as workload increases. That workload falls within the parameters of normal working conditions.

Stress Testing
Unlike load testing, stress testing — also known as fatigue testing — is meant to measure system performance outside of the parameters of normal working conditions. The software is given more users or transactions that can be handled. The goal of stress testing is to measure the software stability. At what point does software fail, and how does the software recover from failure?

Spike Testing
Spike testing is a type of stress testing that evaluates software performance when workloads are substantially increased quickly and repeatedly. The workload is beyond normal expectations for short amounts of time.

Endurance Testing
Endurance testing — also known as soak testing — is an evaluation of how software performs with a normal workload over an extended amount of time. The goal of endurance testing is to check for system problems such as memory leaks. (A memory leak occurs when a system fails to release discarded memory. The memory leak can impair system performance or cause it to fail.)

Scalability Testing
Scalability testing is used to determine if software is effectively handling increasing workloads. This can be determined by gradually adding to the user load or data volume while monitoring system performance. Also, the workload may stay at the same level while resources such as CPUs and memory are changed.

Volume Testing
Volume testing determines how efficiently software performs with large projected amounts of data. It is also known as flood testing because the test floods the system with data.","Load testing – checks the application’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live.

2,"Features and Functionality supported by a software system are not the only concern. A software application’s performance, like its response time, reliability, resource usage, and scalability, do matter. The goal of Performance Testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks.

Performance Testing is done to provide stakeholders with information about their application regarding speed, stability, and scalability. More importantly, Performance Testing uncovers what needs to be improved before the product goes to market. Without Performance Testing, the software is likely to suffer from issues such as: running slow while several users use it simultaneously, inconsistencies across different operating systems, and poor usability. Performance testing will determine whether their software meets speed, scalability, and stability requirements under expected workloads. Applications sent to market with poor performance metrics due to nonexistent or poor performance testing are likely to gain a bad reputation and fail to meet expected sales goals.",Why do Performance Testing?,"Performance testing helps identify and eliminate performance-related issues early in the development cycle, which reduces the time and cost of fixing them later. This allows developers to focus on other critical tasks, increasing productivity.","imagine you're working on a big school project, and you want to make sure everything runs smoothly. Performance testing is like checking your project as you go along to catch any issues early on. This is super helpful because fixing small problems now is much easier than trying to sort them out right before the project is due.

So, in the world of creating things (like software), performance testing is like making sure everything works well from the start. It's a bit like finding and fixing mistakes in your project so that you have more time to focus on other important stuff, making you more productive",3,5

1,"Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, and its importance can be attributed to several key reasons:

Quality of Input Data:

Machine learning models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Poor-quality data, which may contain errors, missing values, or outliers, can lead to inaccurate and unreliable models. Preprocessing helps in cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for training models.
Handling Missing Values:

Real-world datasets often have missing values due to various reasons such as sensor failures, data corruption, or human errors. Preprocessing involves strategies for handling missing data, such as imputation or removal of affected samples or features.
Dealing with Noisy Data:

Noise in the data can be introduced by outliers or irrelevant information. Outliers can significantly impact the training process and model performance. Data preprocessing techniques help in identifying and handling noisy data to improve the overall robustness of the model.
Normalization and Scaling:

Different features in a dataset may have different scales, and some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of input features. Normalization and scaling techniques (e.g., Min-Max scaling or z-score normalization) ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process, preventing some features from dominating others.
Handling Categorical Data:

Many machine learning algorithms require numerical input, but real-world data often includes categorical variables. Encoding categorical variables into a suitable format, such as one-hot encoding, is part of the preprocessing step.
Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the performance of the model. This process can include operations like polynomial feature expansion, log transformations, or creating interaction terms. Effective feature engineering can uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data.
Dimensionality Reduction:

High-dimensional datasets can suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computation time and overfitting. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be applied during preprocessing to retain essential information while reducing the number of features.
Ensuring Consistency:

Data from various sources may have inconsistencies in terms of format, units, or other properties. Preprocessing helps in standardizing and ensuring the consistency of data, making it compatible for training machine learning models.
Improving Model Performance:

Well-preprocessed data can lead to better model performance. By addressing issues like noise, outliers, and missing values, preprocessing contributes to the creation of more accurate and robust machine learning models.

Autonomous Systems:

Autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and drones, use AI algorithms to navigate and make real-time decisions based on their surroundings. These systems can react to dynamic and unpredictable situations without being explicitly programmed for each scenario.
Natural Language Processing:

Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled computers to understand and generate human-like language. Chatbots and virtual assistants, for example, can engage in conversations and perform tasks based on user input without pre-programmed responses for every possible interaction.
Creativity in AI:

AI systems, particularly in the realm of creative fields like art and music, have demonstrated the ability to generate novel and unique outputs. Creative AI models can compose music, generate artwork, or even write literature, showcasing a level of creativity that goes beyond explicit programming.
Reinforcement Learning:

Reinforcement learning allows computers to learn from interactions with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This learning process enables machines to make decisions and optimize their behavior over time, even in complex and dynamic environments.",3,5
1,"Top Python Machine Learning Libraries
1) NumPy
NumPy is a well known general-purpose array-processing package. An extensive collection of high complexity mathematical functions make NumPy powerful to process large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. NumPy is very useful for handling linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random numbers. Other libraries like TensorFlow uses NumPy at the backend for manipulating tensors.

With NumPy, you can define arbitrary data types and easily integrate with most databases. NumPy can also serve as an efficient multi-dimensional container for any generic data that is in any datatype. The key features of NumPy include powerful N-dimensional array object, broadcasting functions, and out-of-box tools to integrate C/C++ and Fortran code. 2) SciPy
With machine learning growing at supersonic speed, many Python developers were creating python libraries for machine learning, especially for scientific and analytical computing. Travis Oliphant, Eric Jones, and Pearu Peterson in 2001 decided to merge most of these bits and pieces codes and standardize it. The resulting library was then named as SciPy library. 

The current development of the SciPy library is supported and sponsored by an open community of developers and distributed under the free BSD license.

The SciPy library offers modules for linear algebra, image optimization, integration interpolation, special functions, Fast Fourier transform, signal and image processing, Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving, and other computational tasks in science and analytics.

The underlying data structure used by SciPy is a multi-dimensional array provided by the NumPy module. SciPy depends on NumPy for the array manipulation subroutines. The SciPy library was built to work with NumPy arrays along with providing user-friendly and efficient numerical functions.

FYI: Free nlp course!

One of the unique features of SciPy is that its functions are useful in maths and other sciences. Some of its extensively used functions are optimization functions, statistical functions, and signal processing. It supports functions for finding the numerical solute to integrals. So you can solve differential equations and optimization.

The following areas of SciPy’s applications make it one of the popular machine learning libraries.

Multidimensional image processing
Solves Fourier transforms, and differential equations
Its optimized algorithms help you to efficiently and reliably perform linear algebra calculations
3) Scikit-learn
In 2007, David Cournapeau developed the Scikit-learn library as part of the Google Summer of Code project. In 2010 INRIA involved and did the public release in January 2010. Skikit-learn was built on top of two Python libraries – NumPy and SciPy and has become the most popular Python machine learning library for developing machine learning algorithms.  

Scikit-learn has a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms that works on a consistent interface in Python. The library can also be used for data-mining and data analysis. The main machine learning functions that the Scikit-learn library can handle are classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.

Many ML enthusiasts and data scientists use scikit-learn in their AI journey. Essentially, it is an all-inclusive machine learning framework. Occasionally, many people overlook it because of the prevalence of more cutting-edge Python libraries and frameworks. However, it is still a powerful library and efficiently solves complex Machine Learning tasks.

The following features of scikit-learn make it one of the best machine learning libraries in Python:

Easy to use for precise predictive data analysis
Simplifies solving complex ML problems like classification, preprocessing, clustering, regression, model selection, and dimensionality reduction
Plenty of inbuilt machine learning algorithms
Helps build a fundamental to advanced level ML model

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics that poses a hypothetical scenario in which a person is required to make a choice between two negative outcomes.
Using the four paradigms to solve the problem:
•	Think Humanly
When thinking humanly the Artificial Intelligence tried to understand and model how the human mind works, it tries to emulate activities that are associate to human thinking, activities such as decision making, problem solving, learning. Etc.
If we are going to say that a given program thinks like human, we must have some way of determining how humans think. We need to go inside the actual workings of human minds.
	In the question, we are presented with a scenario similar to the trolley problem, it has to make the decision of whether to go on path A which has the baby on it, or go through path B with the elderly woman. If the machine was to think humanly, it would hit the old woman and save the baby or come to an halt to save both the baby and the old woman.
•	Think Rationally
When thinking rationally, the AI tries to understand and model how to perceive, reason and act. 
In the question, we are presented with a scenario similar to the trolley problem, it has to make the decision of whether to go on path A which has the baby on it, or go through path B with the elderly woman. If the machine was to think humanly and in a real-world scenario, the autonomous vehicle would come to an halt to avoid hitting either the old woman or the baby.
•	Act Humanly 
For a machine to act humanly, definitely it must think humanly. Therefore, it would either kill the old woman and save the baby or come to a halt to save both the baby and the human.
•	Act Rationally
An agent is just something that acts. But computer agents are expected to have other attributes that distinguish them from mere ""programs,"" such as operating under autonomous control, perceiving their environment, persisting over prolonged time period, adapting to change, and being capable of taking on another's goals. A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.

1,"1. Neural Network (NN)
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.
Neural Network can be used to approximate non-linear systems which makes it evidence based. Also, because it can approximate non-linear system, it can be applied to a lot of environment application because they are non-linear. Neural Network can be used for regression and classification but mostly for regression, meaning it can be used to estimate an unknown parameter from data already known.

FEATURES OF NN
1.	Simple Structure: It is optimal.
2.	Less Training Parameters: It isn’t hard to train as the training process is well understood
3.	Adaptable and Easy to Implement: It is just the sum of exponentials and one of the reasons it is adaptable is because it is easy to implement. It can be applied to different environment scenarios.

2. Genetic Algorithm (GA) 
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection. It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime to solve. It is frequently used to solve optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
Features of Genetic Algorithm
1.	Does not require any derivative information (which may not be available for many real-world problems).
2.	Is faster and more efficient as compared to the neural network.
3.	Has very good parallel capabilities.
4.	Optimizes both continuous and discrete functions and also multi-objective problems.
5.	Provides a list of “good” solutions and not just a single solution.
6.	Always gets an answer to the problem, which gets better over the time.
7.	Useful when the search space is very large and there are a large number of parameters involved.

Applications of Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm has many applications in real world.
1.	Optimization: Genetic Algorithms are most commonly used in optimization problems wherein we have to maximize or minimize a given objective function value under a given set of constraints. 
2.	Economics: GA is also used to characterize various economic models like the cobweb model, game theory equilibrium resolution, asset pricing, etc.
3.	Neural Networks: GA is also used to train neural networks, particularly recurrent neural networks.
4.	Parallelization: GAs also have very good parallel capabilities, and prove to be very effective means in solving certain problems, and also provide a good area for research.
5.	Image Processing: GA is used for various digital image processing (DIP) tasks as well like dense pixel matching.
6.	Vehicle Routing Problems: With multiple soft time windows, multiple depots and a heterogeneous fleet.
7.	Scheduling Applications: GA is used to solve various scheduling problems as well, particularly the time tabling problem.
8.	Machine Learning: as already discussed, genetics-based machine learning (GBML) is a niche area in machine learning.
9.	Robot Trajectory Generation: GA have been used to plan the path which a robot arm takes by moving from one point to another.
10.	Parametric Design of Aircraft: GA have been used to design aircrafts by varying the parameters and evolving better solutions.
11.	DNA Analysis: GA have been used to determine the structure of DNA using spectrometric data about the sample.
12.	Multimodal Optimization: GA is obviously very good approaches for multimodal optimization in which we have to find multiple optimum solutions.
13.	Traveling salesman problem and its applications: GA have been used to solve the TSP, which is a well-known combinatorial problem using novel crossover and packing strategies.

3. Decision Tree
Decision tree is supervised learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly this is ideally for solving Classification problems. It is a tree structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In decision tree, there are two modes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision Nodes are used for making any decision and have numerous branches, whereas Leaf Nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree
1.	It has three parts which are the nodes, edges and leaves.
2.	It is non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
3.	It classifies examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, with the leaf node providing the classification to the example.
4.	One of the basic algorithms used in decision tree is ID3
5.	SCIKIT-LEARN library is used to build decision learning model
Applications of Decision Tree:
1.	Face Recognition: Face recognition finds its applications in our smartphones and any other place with Biometric security. Face Recognition is nothing but face detection followed by classification. The classification algorithm determines if the face in the image matches with the registered user or not.
2.	Medical Image Classification: Given the data of patients, a model that is well trained is often used to classify if the patient has a malignant tumor (cancer), heart ailments, fractures, etc.
3.	Stock Market Prediction: Regression algorithms are used to predict the future price of stocks based on certain past features like time of the day or festival time, etc. Stock Market Prediction also falls under a subdomain of study called Time Series Analysis.
4.	Object Detection Algorithms: Object Detection is the process of detection of the location of a given object in an image or video. This process returns the coordinates of the pixel values stating the location of the object in the image. These coordinates are determined by using regression algorithms alongside classification.

SOLUTION
Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). Example: Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. . (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. More input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.
Examples: 
•	Feature selection. ...
•	Feature extraction. ...
•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ...
•	Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) ...

3. Decision Tree
Decision tree is supervised learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly this is ideally for solving Classification problems. It is a tree structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In decision tree, there are two modes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision Nodes are used for making any decision and have numerous branches, whereas Leaf Nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree
1.	It has three parts which are the nodes, edges and leaves.
2.	It is non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
3.	It classifies examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, with the leaf node providing the classification to the example.
4.	One of the basic algorithms used in decision tree is ID3
5.	SCIKIT-LEARN library is used to build decision learning model
Applications of Decision Tree:
1.	Face Recognition: Face recognition finds its applications in our smartphones and any other place with Biometric security. Face Recognition is nothing but face detection followed by classification. The classification algorithm determines if the face in the image matches with the registered user or not.
2.	Medical Image Classification: Given the data of patients, a model that is well trained is often used to classify if the patient has a malignant tumor (cancer), heart ailments, fractures, etc.
3.	Stock Market Prediction: Regression algorithms are used to predict the future price of stocks based on certain past features like time of the day or festival time, etc. Stock Market Prediction also falls under a subdomain of study called Time Series Analysis.
4.	Object Detection Algorithms: Object Detection is the process of detection of the location of a given object in an image or video. This process returns the coordinates of the pixel values stating the location of the object in the image. These coordinates are determined by using regression algorithms alongside classification.

SOLUTION
Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). Example: Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. . (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. More input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.
Examples: 
•	Feature selection. ...
•	Feature extraction. ...
•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ...
•	Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) ...
•	Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) ...

A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.
Neural Network can be used to approximate non-linear systems which makes it evidence based. Also, because it can approximate non-linear system, it can be applied to a lot of environment application because they are non-linear. Neural Network can be used for regression and classification but mostly for regression, meaning it can be used to estimate an unknown parameter from data already known.

FEATURES OF NN

3. Decision Tree
Decision tree is supervised learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly this is ideally for solving Classification problems. It is a tree structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In decision tree, there are two modes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision Nodes are used for making any decision and have numerous branches, whereas Leaf Nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree
1.	It has three parts which are the nodes, edges and leaves.
2.	It is non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
3.	It classifies examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, with the leaf node providing the classification to the example.
4.	One of the basic algorithms used in decision tree is ID3
5.	SCIKIT-LEARN library is used to build decision learning model
Applications of Decision Tree:
1.	Face Recognition: Face recognition finds its applications in our smartphones and any other place with Biometric security. Face Recognition is nothing but face detection followed by classification. The classification algorithm determines if the face in the image matches with the registered user or not.
2.	Medical Image Classification: Given the data of patients, a model that is well trained is often used to classify if the patient has a malignant tumor (cancer), heart ailments, fractures, etc.
3.	Stock Market Prediction: Regression algorithms are used to predict the future price of stocks based on certain past features like time of the day or festival time, etc. Stock Market Prediction also falls under a subdomain of study called Time Series Analysis.
4.	Object Detection Algorithms: Object Detection is the process of detection of the location of a given object in an image or video. This process returns the coordinates of the pixel values stating the location of the object in the image. These coordinates are determined by using regression algorithms alongside classification.

SOLUTION
Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). Example: Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. . (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)

Definition:
Classification is a supervised learning task in machine learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of instances based on their features.

Example:
Consider a spam email classifier. The task is to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). The features could include the presence of certain keywords, the sender's address, and other attributes. The algorithm learns from labeled examples to predict the class label of new, unseen emails.

Regression:
Definition:
Regression is also a supervised learning task, but instead of predicting categorical labels, it aims to predict continuous numerical values.

Example:
Suppose you are building a house price prediction model. The goal is to predict the price of a house based on features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc. The algorithm learns from historical data with known house prices to make predictions for new houses.

Dimensionality Reduction:
Definition:
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving its essential information. It is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with a large number of features, as it can improve computational efficiency and reduce the risk of overfitting.

Example:
Consider a dataset with numerous features describing a person, including age, income, education level, and more. Using dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), you can transform these features into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables while retaining the most important information. This reduced set of features can simplify analysis and modeling.",4,4

Here are some justifications for the limitations of expert systems:

Limited to Explicit Knowledge:

Expert systems rely on explicitly coded knowledge provided by human experts. They may struggle with knowledge that is tacit or hard to articulate, which is common in certain domains where intuition and experience play a significant role.
Lack of Common Sense Reasoning:

Expert systems often lack common sense reasoning abilities that humans naturally possess. They may not perform well in situations where implicit knowledge or contextual understanding is crucial.
Difficulty Handling Uncertainty:

Expert systems may struggle with uncertain or ambiguous information. Real-world scenarios often involve incomplete or imprecise data, and expert systems may not effectively handle uncertainty in decision-making.",4,4

Smart personal assistants and Chatbots are used to visualize interactive AI because they have capacities that can vary from replying pre-built questions to understanding the conversation framework. Interactive AI can also be used in improving a company’s interior procedures. The Figure below shows the various types of artificial intelligence.
2. Functional Artificial intelligence (FAI)
Functional AI is very similar to analytic AI.  Enormous quantities of data are needed for scanning and locating patterns as well as dependencies. However, functional AI jumps into action instead of giving references. For instance, functional AI can identify a machine-breakdown patterns in the device data received from a confident machine and a command is generated to turn off this machine because of being the part of the IoT cloud.  Another example: robots being used by Amazon to bring the tables with the items on it to the pickers, during this process the picking process is being speed up. Functional AI can also improve a company’s interior procedures. For example, creation of chatbot to facilitate the corporate process of vacation booking.
3. Analytic Artificial Intelligence (AAI)
It is a type of AI that is motorised with machine learning (including its most innovative unrestricted learning systems), analytic AI scans loads of data for dependences and outlines to finally produce references or provide a business with visions, thus contributing to data-driven decision-making. Dealer Risk Assessment and Sentiment Study are the example of analytic AI in action. 
4. Text Artificial Intelligence (TAI)
Examples of text AI that can be enjoy by businesses using it are speech-to-text conversion, content generation capabilities, text recognition and machine translation. Text powered by AI can find the document containing the most appropriate answer even if the document doesn’t have full keywords contrary to a traditional knowledge-base that rests upon a search by keywords. AI is permitted to build semantic maps by keywords and identify synonyms to appreciate the framework of the user’s questions through the help of ordinary language dispensation and semantic search.

5. Visual Artificial Intelligence (VAI)
visual AI enables, businesses to classify, identify, categorize and categorise objects or change videos and images into visions. Examples of visual AI is a computer system that enables a guarantor to evaluate damage based on damaged machine car or a photo that grades apples based on their size and colour. This type of AI covers augmented reality or computer vision fields.

1,"Model:

A model is a representation or abstraction of a real-world system, process, or phenomenon. In the context of machine learning, a model is a mathematical or computational representation that captures patterns, relationships, or behaviors present in data. Models are trained on data to learn these patterns and can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. Models can take various forms, including linear models, decision trees, neural networks, and more.

Algorithm:

An algorithm, on the other hand, is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules for solving a particular problem or performing a specific task. In the context of machine learning, an algorithm refers to the process or method used to train a model. It defines how the model learns from the training data, adjusts its parameters, and generalizes to make predictions on new data. Algorithms are the underlying procedures that guide the learning process and determine how a model is trained and updated.
",Distinguish between a Model and an Algorithm,"A “model” in machine learning is the output of a machine learning algorithm run on data.
A model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm.
The model is the “thing” that is saved after running a machine learning algorithm on training data and represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures required to make predictions   

While

An “algorithm” in machine learning is a procedure that is run on data to create a machine learning “model.”
Machine learning algorithms perform “pattern recognition.” Algorithms “learn” from data, or are “fit” on a dataset.	
Specifically, an algorithm is run on data to create a model.

1,"Learning in machine learning is divided broadly into four types such as statistical inference, learning techniques,  learning problem and hybrid learning. Deep learning and evolutionary learning have evolved as other classes of learning in machine learning in addition to the four categories earlier mentioned making the learning types six in classification. 
Each of these major classifications is given below with their subdivisions:
i. Statistical inference
Statistical inference denotes the method through which inferences are drawn from the model estimate. Inference is the attainment of a conclusion or choice. In machine learning both forms of inference are to fit a model and predict. Inferences may be used as a foundation for understanding how certain machine learning algorithms function or how certain learning issues can be dealt with.
These examples of learning under this category are transductive learning, in addition to inductive learning and deductive inference. 
ii. Learning techniques 
Many approaches are classified as learning techniques. Active learning, ensemble learning, online learning, transfer learning as well as multi-task learning are machine learning group referred to as learning techniques.
iii. Learning Problems
There are three basic categories of learning problems in machine learning. This can be classified under these three types like supervised learning, reinforcement, together with unsupervised learning
iv. Hybrid learning Problems
The borders between supervised and unsupervised learning are blurred, and numerous hybrid techniques are derived from every field of research. Hybrid Learning includes self-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning and Multi-Instance Learning.
v. Deep learning
Deep Learning (DL) is a ML variant that is extremely sophisticated which use more advanced approaches to solve tough issues. According to, deep leaning is decisive. DL includes neural networks (NN), a sort of algorithm patterned after the physical nature of human brain. NN appears as the fundamentally profound aspect of AI enquiry because they offer a far more accurate human brain simulation all the more so better than before. Deep learning designs can reach the latest accuracy, specificity and possibly higher performance compared with human beings. The use of a complete range of labeled data in addition to multi-faceted neural network architecture are trained for these approaches.
vi. Evolutionary learning 
Evolutionary learning uses evolutionary algorithms to tackle machine learning optimization issues and has led to positive results in many areas. Due to the heuristic character of the optimisation of evolution, however, most of the results thus far were experiential and without theoretical inclination. Evolutionary learning is highly regarded in the community of machine learning due to the weakness, which promotes sound theoretical methods.

They will also identify potential issues earlier in the project and provide accurate estimates based on the client’s business requirements. It identifies the issue and makes it easier to solve.
Streamlines the process. When software engineering teams follow the process, they spend time meeting with the client and developing the software idea in the early stages. During this time, the team can go over the entire process and eliminate any steps that do not add value to the software development process.
Prevent issues during software development. Following the software engineering processes can help to prevent problems from arising. For example, the end result may be unattainable if the client and the software engineering team do not communicate effectively. The client must be involved in the process from the start. When they collaborate, they can create software that meets and exceeds its intended purpose.",What Are Software Engineering Processes Good For,"Adhering to software engineering processes is cost-effective and time-efficient, reducing the risk of project rejection by clients upon completion.

3,"Cost estimation models are some mathematical algorithms or parametric equations that are used to estimate the cost of a product or a project. Various techniques or models are available for cost estimation, also known as Cost Estimation Models as shown below: Empirical Estimation Technique – Empirical estimation is a technique or model in which empirically derived formulas are used for predicting the data that are a required and essential part of the software project planning step. These techniques are usually based on the data that is collected previously from a project and also based on some guesses, prior experience with the development of similar types of projects, and assumptions. It uses the size of the software to estimate the effort. In this technique, an educated guess of project parameters is made. Hence, these models are based on common sense. However, as there are many activities involved in empirical estimation techniques, this technique is formalized. For example Delphi technique and Expert Judgement technique.
Heuristic Technique – Heuristic word is derived from a Greek word that means “to discover”. The heuristic technique is a technique or model that is used for solving problems, learning, or discovery in the practical methods which are used for achieving immediate goals. These techniques are flexible and simple for taking quick decisions through shortcuts and good enough calculations, most probably when working with complex data. But the decisions that are made using this technique are necessary to be optimal. In this technique, the relationship among different project parameters is expressed using mathematical equations. The popular heuristic technique is given by Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO). This technique is also used to increase or speed up the analysis and investment decisions.
Analytical Estimation Technique – Analytical estimation is a type of technique that is used to measure work. In this technique, firstly the task is divided or broken down into its basic component operations or elements for analyzing. Second, if the standard time is available from some other source, then these sources are applied to each element or component of work. Third, if there is no such time available, then the work is estimated based on the experience of the work. In this technique, results are derived by making certain basic assumptions about the project. Hence, the analytical estimation technique has some scientific basis. Halstead’s software science is based on an analytical estimation model.
Other Cost Estimation Models are:
Function Point Analysis (FPA): This technique counts the number and complexity of functions that a piece of software can perform to determine how functional and sophisticated it is. The effort needed for development, testing and maintenance can be estimated using this model.
Putnam Model: This model is a parametric estimation model that estimates effort, time and faults by taking into account the size of the the programme, the expertise of the development team and other project-specific characteristics.
Price-to-Win Estimation: Often utilized in competitive bidding, this model is concerned with projecting the expenses associated with developing a particular software project in order to secure a contract. It involves looking at market dynamics and competitors.
Models Based on Machine Learning: Custom cost estimating models can be built using machine learning techniques including neural networks, regression analysis and decision trees. These models are based on past project data. These models are flexible enough to adjust to changing data and project-specific features.
Function Points Model (IFPUG): A standardized technique for gauging the functionality of software using function points is offered by the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG).

Features explanation
Object Oriented
Ruby is purely object-oriented programming language. Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. Every code has their properties and actions. Ruby is influenced with Smalltalk language. Rules applying to objects applies to the entire Ruby.

Flexibility
Ruby is a flexible language as you can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish.

Mixins
Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.

Dynamic typing and Duck typing
Ruby is a dynamic programming language. Ruby programs are not compiled. All class, module and method definition are built by the code when it run.

Ruby variables are loosely typed language, which means any variable can hold any type of object. When a method is called on an object, Ruby only looks up at the name irrespective of the type of object. This is duck typing. It allows you to make classes that pretend to be other classes.

Variable constants
In Ruby, constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.",List FIVE features of Ruby language and explain any THREE,"Ruby Features:

1.	Multi-paradigm language: It supports at least 7 different styles of programming
2.	General Purpose languages: It is used in developing, game, desktop, apps, operating systems etc.
3.	Speed: Performance is exceptional.
4.	Object-Oriented: It allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.
5.	Machine Independent: It is machine independent (it can be written on any operating system) but platform dependent (compiled on one operating system won’t run on another).
6.	Compiler-based: That is, C++ programs used to be compiled and their executed file is used to run it.
7.	Case sensitive
8.	Dynamic Memory Allocation: it allows us to allocate the memory of a variable or an array in run-time.
9.	Multithreading: it doesn’t contain any built-in support for multithreading applications, instead it relies entirely upon the os to supply this feature
10.	Mid-level programming languge: it is a programming languge that collects special features of high and low level language
11.	Rich Library: its library is full of in-built functions that save a huge amount of time in the software development phase. Hence, saves programming time and increase development speed.
12.	Recursion: Due to code reusability features, functions can be called within a function saving memory space by not rewriting codes.
Areas of applications
i.	Games: C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU intensive functions and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking. All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop the gaming systems as well as game development suites.
ii.	GUI Based application: C++ is used in developing desktop/GUI application e.g. Adobe, etc.
iii.	Database software: C++ is also used in written Database Management systems e.g. MySQL server
iv.	Operating System: C++ as a middle level language can be send in written an operating system, also because it is a strongly typed and fast programming language, it is ideal candidate for writing operating system.  e.g. Window OS, Linux OS
v.	Browser: Most browsers are written in C++ due to its fast performance e.g. Mozilla, Chrome, Tor etc.
vi.	Advanced Computation and graphics: C++ is useful in developing an application that requires high-performance image processing, real-time physical simulations, and mobile sensor applications that need high performance and speed. e.g. alias system
vii.	Banking Application: for banking applications that require multi-threading, concurrency, and high performance, C++ has been the best language due to it great performance. e.g. Infosys Finacle.
viii.	Cloud/Distributed system: C++ becomes a default choice for implementing such systems as it is close to the hardware and also provides multithreading support that can build concurrent applications and load tolerance.
ix.	Compilers: Compilers of various high-level programming languages are written in C++ because C++ is a middle-level language that is close to hardware and is able to program and manipulate the underlying hardware resources.
x.	Embedded system: Various embedded systems like smartwatches, medical equipment systems use C++ to program as it is closer to the hardware level and can provide a lot of low-level function calls when compared to the other high-level programming languages
Creator: Bjarne Stroustrup
Used by and uses: 
o	Google ? Google file system, Google Chromium browser, and MapReduce large cluster data processing are all written in C++.
o	Mozilla ? Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird email chat client is both written using C++.
o	MySQL ? MySQL, an open source DBMS is written using C++.
o	Microsoft ? Many windows apps that you regularly use are written in C++.
o	Rockstar Games ? Almost all major game companies use C++ due to its sheer speed on bare metal. Many major game engines are fully written in C++ and leverage its speed and OOP capabilities.
o	MongoDB ? An open-source database, widely used as the back end store for web applications, as well as in large enterprises like Viacom and Disney.
o	Morgan Stanley ? They use it for a huge part of their financial modeling. The creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup works here.

i.	Games: C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU intensive functions and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking. All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop the gaming systems as well as game development suites.
ii.	GUI Based application: C++ is used in developing desktop/GUI application e.g. Adobe, etc.
iii.	Database software: C++ is also used in written Database Management systems e.g. MySQL server
iv.	Operating System: C++ as a middle level language can be send in written an operating system, also because it is a strongly typed and fast programming language, it is ideal candidate for writing operating system.  e.g. Window OS, Linux OS
v.	Browser: Most browsers are written in C++ due to its fast performance e.g. Mozilla, Chrome, Tor etc.
vi.	Advanced Computation and graphics: C++ is useful in developing an application that requires high-performance image processing, real-time physical simulations, and mobile sensor applications that need high performance and speed. e.g. alias system
vii.	Banking Application: for banking applications that require multi-threading, concurrency, and high performance, C++ has been the best language due to it great performance. e.g. Infosys Finacle.
viii.	Cloud/Distributed system: C++ becomes a default choice for implementing such systems as it is close to the hardware and also provides multithreading support that can build concurrent applications and load tolerance.
ix.	Compilers: Compilers of various high-level programming languages are written in C++ because C++ is a middle-level language that is close to hardware and is able to program and manipulate the underlying hardware resources.
x.	Embedded system: Various embedded systems like smartwatches, medical equipment systems use C++ to program as it is closer to the hardware level and can provide a lot of low-level function calls when compared to the other high-level programming languages

It is a high-level programming language designed for string manipulation and pattern matching. SNOBOL is known for its powerful string processing capabilities, making it well-suited for tasks involving text manipulation and analysis. Here are three examples of areas where SNOBOL has found applications:

Text Processing and Parsing:

SNOBOL is commonly used for tasks that involve processing and manipulating textual data. Its pattern-matching abilities make it effective for parsing and extracting information from strings. Applications include text analysis, data extraction from unstructured text, and natural language processing.
Symbolic Computing:

SNOBOL is often used in symbolic computing applications, where the manipulation of symbols and patterns is essential. This includes tasks such as symbolic mathematics, formal language processing, and the development of domain-specific languages for symbolic manipulation.
Pattern Matching in Bioinformatics:

SNOBOL's powerful pattern-matching features make it suitable for applications in bioinformatics, where DNA and protein sequence analysis often involves complex pattern matching. Researchers have utilized SNOBOL for tasks such as sequence alignment, pattern searching in genetic data, and the development of bioinformatics algorithms.",2,4

1,"Artificial neural networks and deep learning AI technologies are quickly evolving, primarily because AI can process large amounts of data much faster and make predictions more accurately than humanly possible.

While the huge volume of data created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications using machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. As of this writing, a primary disadvantage of AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data AI programming requires. As AI techniques are incorporated into more products and services, organizations must also be attuned to AI's potential to create biased and discriminatory systems, intentionally or inadvertently.

Advantages of AI
The following are some advantages of AI.

Good at detail-oriented jobs. AI has proven to be just as good, if not better than doctors at diagnosing certain cancers, including breast cancer and melanoma.
Reduced time for data-heavy tasks. AI is widely used in data-heavy industries, including banking and securities, pharma and insurance, to reduce the time it takes to analyze big data sets. Financial services, for example, routinely use AI to process loan applications and detect fraud.
Saves labor and increases productivity. An example here is the use of warehouse automation, which grew during the pandemic and is expected to increase with the integration of AI and machine learning.
Delivers consistent results. The best AI translation tools deliver high levels of consistency, offering even small businesses the ability to reach customers in their native language.
Can improve customer satisfaction through personalization. AI can personalize content, messaging, ads, recommendations and websites to individual customers.

1,"Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at Michigan State University, explained that AI can be categorized into four types, beginning with the task-specific intelligent systems in wide use today and progressing to sentient systems, which do not yet exist. The categories are as follows.

Type 1: Reactive machines. These AI systems have no memory and are task-specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on a chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.
Type 2: Limited memory. These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.
Type 3: Theory of mind. Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI systems to become integral members of human teams.

Think of these like one-trick ponies. They can do one specific job really well, like playing chess (just like Deep Blue did in the '90s), but they can't remember past games or experiences. It's all about the task at hand.
Type 2: Limited Memory

These AI systems are a bit better. They can remember some stuff from the past, so when they're making decisions, they can use what they've learned before. For example, some parts of self-driving cars work this way—they remember past situations to drive better.
Type 3: Theory of Mind

Now, we're getting into AI that understands people a bit more. Think of it like a computer that can ""get"" human feelings. It might predict what you're going to do based on how you're feeling. This is important for AI to work well with humans on teams.

1,"The ongoing success of applied AI and cognitive simulation, as described in the preceding sections of this article, seems assured. However, artificial general intelligence (AGI), or strong AI—that is, artificial intelligence that aims to duplicate human intellectual abilities—remains controversial and out of reach. Exaggerated claims of success, in professional journals as well as in the popular press, have damaged its reputation. At the present time even an embodied system displaying the overall intelligence of a cockroach is proving elusive, let alone a system that can rival a human being. The difficulty of scaling up AI’s modest achievements cannot be overstated. Decades of research in symbolic AI have failed to produce any firm evidence that a symbol system can manifest human levels of general intelligence; connectionists are unable to model the nervous systems of even the simplest invertebrates; and critics of nouvelle AI regard as simply mystical the view that high-level behaviours involving language understanding, planning, and reasoning will somehow emerge from the interaction of basic behaviours such as obstacle avoidance, gaze control, and object manipulation.

However, this lack of substantial progress may simply be testimony to the difficulty of AGI, not to its impossibility. Let us turn to the very idea of AGI. Can a computer possibly think? Noam Chomsky suggests that debating this question is pointless, for it is an essentially arbitrary decision whether to extend common usage of the word think to include machines. There is, Chomsky claims, no factual question as to whether any such decision is right or wrong—just as there is no question as to whether our decision to say that airplanes fly is right, or our decision not to say that ships swim is wrong. However, this seems to oversimplify matters. The important question is: Could it ever be appropriate to say that computers think and, if so, what conditions must a computer satisfy in order to be so described?

Some authors offer the Turing test as a definition of intelligence. However, Turing himself pointed out that a computer that ought to be described as intelligent might nevertheless fail his test if it were incapable of successfully imitating a human being. For example, ChatGPT continually invokes its status as a large language model and thus would be unlikely to pass the Turing test. If an intelligent entity can fail the test, then the test cannot function as a definition of intelligence. It is even questionable whether passing the test would actually show that a computer is intelligent, as the information theorist Claude Shannon and the AI pioneer John McCarthy pointed out in 1956. Shannon and McCarthy argued that in principle it is possible to design a machine containing a complete set of canned responses to all the questions that an interrogator could possibly ask during the fixed time span of the test. Like Parry, this machine would produce answers to the interviewer’s questions by looking up appropriate responses in a giant table. This objection seems to show that in principle a system with no intelligence at all could pass the Turing test.

In fact, AI has no real definition of intelligence to offer, not even in the subhuman case. Rats are intelligent, but what exactly must an artificial intelligence achieve before researchers can claim that it has reached rats’ level of success? In the absence of a reasonably precise criterion for when an artificial system counts as intelligent, there is no objective way of telling whether an AI research program has succeeded or failed. One result of AI’s failure to produce a satisfactory criterion of intelligence is that, whenever researchers achieve one of AI’s goals—for example, a program that can summarize newspaper articles or beat the world chess champion—critics are able to say, “That’s not intelligence!” Marvin Minsky’s response to the problem of defining intelligence is to maintain—like Turing before him—that intelligence is simply our name for any problem-solving mental process that we do not yet understand.

Imagine your phone predicting your needs or streaming services magically suggesting your next binge-watch—that's AI doing its magic! Now, picture this excitement leveling up to creating artificial general intelligence (AGI), where machines become as smart as humans. It's not just about following commands; it's about computers truly understanding and learning like us. Think of it as transforming our devices into super-smart assistants, capable of a wide range of tasks. The future seems promising for AI—it's like watching technology unfold its own kind of wizardry",4,5
1,"The ongoing success of applied AI and cognitive simulation, as described in the preceding sections of this article, seems assured. However, artificial general intelligence (AGI), or strong AI—that is, artificial intelligence that aims to duplicate human intellectual abilities—remains controversial and out of reach. Exaggerated claims of success, in professional journals as well as in the popular press, have damaged its reputation. At the present time even an embodied system displaying the overall intelligence of a cockroach is proving elusive, let alone a system that can rival a human being. The difficulty of scaling up AI’s modest achievements cannot be overstated. Decades of research in symbolic AI have failed to produce any firm evidence that a symbol system can manifest human levels of general intelligence; connectionists are unable to model the nervous systems of even the simplest invertebrates; and critics of nouvelle AI regard as simply mystical the view that high-level behaviours involving language understanding, planning, and reasoning will somehow emerge from the interaction of basic behaviours such as obstacle avoidance, gaze control, and object manipulation.

However, this lack of substantial progress may simply be testimony to the difficulty of AGI, not to its impossibility. Let us turn to the very idea of AGI. Can a computer possibly think? Noam Chomsky suggests that debating this question is pointless, for it is an essentially arbitrary decision whether to extend common usage of the word think to include machines. There is, Chomsky claims, no factual question as to whether any such decision is right or wrong—just as there is no question as to whether our decision to say that airplanes fly is right, or our decision not to say that ships swim is wrong. However, this seems to oversimplify matters. The important question is: Could it ever be appropriate to say that computers think and, if so, what conditions must a computer satisfy in order to be so described?

Some authors offer the Turing test as a definition of intelligence. However, Turing himself pointed out that a computer that ought to be described as intelligent might nevertheless fail his test if it were incapable of successfully imitating a human being. For example, ChatGPT continually invokes its status as a large language model and thus would be unlikely to pass the Turing test. If an intelligent entity can fail the test, then the test cannot function as a definition of intelligence. It is even questionable whether passing the test would actually show that a computer is intelligent, as the information theorist Claude Shannon and the AI pioneer John McCarthy pointed out in 1956. Shannon and McCarthy argued that in principle it is possible to design a machine containing a complete set of canned responses to all the questions that an interrogator could possibly ask during the fixed time span of the test. Like Parry, this machine would produce answers to the interviewer’s questions by looking up appropriate responses in a giant table. This objection seems to show that in principle a system with no intelligence at all could pass the Turing test.

In fact, AI has no real definition of intelligence to offer, not even in the subhuman case. Rats are intelligent, but what exactly must an artificial intelligence achieve before researchers can claim that it has reached rats’ level of success? In the absence of a reasonably precise criterion for when an artificial system counts as intelligent, there is no objective way of telling whether an AI research program has succeeded or failed.

The current successes are often task-specific and lack the depth of human understanding. Critics argue that the excitement around AGI may be premature, as replicating human-level comprehension and learning remains a substantial challenge. The analogy of turning machines into super-smart assistants is met with caution, given the complexities involved in true cognitive understanding. Some believe that the euphoria around AI's potential needs to be tempered with a realistic assessment of its current limitations in achieving human-like intelligence.",4,5

2,"Unit tests are typically written by developers as they write the code for a given unit. They are usually written in the same programming language as the software and use a testing framework or library that provides the necessary tools for creating and running the tests. These frameworks often include assertion libraries, which allow developers to write test cases that check the output of a given unit against expected results. The tests are usually run automatically and continuously as part of the software build process, and the results are typically displayed in a test runner or a continuous integration tool.

2,"Functional Testing is a type of Software Testing in which the system is tested against the functional requirements and specifications. Functional testing ensures that the requirements or specifications are properly satisfied by the application. This type of testing is particularly concerned with the result of processing.

Functional testing is basically defined as a type of testing that verifies that each function of the software application works in conformance with the requirement and specification. This testing is not concerned with the source code of the application. Each functionality of the software application is tested by providing appropriate test input, expecting the output, and comparing the actual output with the expected output. This testing focuses on checking the user interface, APIs, database, security, client or server application, and functionality of the Application Under Test. Functional testing can be manual or automated. ",Explain Functional Testing,"Functional testing is basically defined as a type of testing that verifies that each function of the software application works in conformance with the requirement and specification.

The application's source code is unrelated to this testing. By giving the proper test input, anticipating the result, and contrasting the actual output with the expected output, each software application capability is tested.",4,5
2,"Functional Testing is a type of Software Testing in which the system is tested against the functional requirements and specifications. Functional testing ensures that the requirements or specifications are properly satisfied by the application. This type of testing is particularly concerned with the result of processing. It focuses on the simulation of actual system usage but does not develop any system structure assumptions. The article focuses on discussing function testing.

2,"Purpose of Functional Testing
Functional testing mainly involves black box testing and can be done manually or using automation. The purpose of functional testing is to:

Test each function of the application: Functional testing tests each function of the application by providing the appropriate input and verifying the output against the functional requirements of the application.
Test primary entry function: In functional testing, the tester tests each entry function of the application to check all the entry and exit points.
Test flow of the GUI screen: In functional testing, the flow of the GUI screen is checked so that the user can navigate throughout the application.",State the purposes of Functional Testing,"Test each function of the application: Functional testing tests each function of the application by providing the appropriate input and verifying the output against the functional requirements of the application.

2,"Type of Functional Testing Techniques
Unit Testing: Unit testing is the type of functional testing technique where the individual units or modules of the application are tested. It ensures that each module is working correctly. 
Integration Testing: In Integration testing, combined individual units are tested as a group and expose the faults in the interaction between the integrated units.
Smoke Testing: Smoke testing is a type of functional testing technique where the basic functionality or feature of the application is tested as it ensures that the most important function works properly. 
User Acceptance Testing: User acceptance testing is done by the client to certify that the system meets the requirements and works as intended. It is the final phase of testing before the product release.
Interface Testing: Interface testing is a type of software testing technique that checks the proper interaction between two different software systems.
Usability Testing: Usability testing is done to measure how easy and user-friendly a software application is. 
System Testing: System testing is a type of software testing that is performed on the complete integrated system to evaluate the compliance of the system with the corresponding requirements. 
Regression Testing: Regression testing is done to make sure that the code changes should not affect the existing functionality and the features of the application. It concentrates on whether all parts are working or not.
Sanity Testing: Sanity testing is a subset of regression testing and is done to make sure that the code changes introduced are working as expected. 
White box Testing: White box testing is a type of software testing that allows the tester to verify the internal workings of the software system. This includes analyzing the code, infrastructure, and integrations with the external system.
Black box Testing: Black box testing is a type of software testing where the functionality of the software system is tested without looking at the internal working or structures of the software system.
Database Testing: Database testing is a type of software testing that checks the schema, tables, etc of the database under test.
Adhoc Testing: Adhoc testing also known as monkey testing or random testing is a type of software testing that does not follow any documentation or test plan to perform testing.
Recovery Testing: Recovery testing is a type of software testing that verifies the software’s ability to recover from the failures like hardware failures, software failures, crashes, etc.
Static Testing: Static testing is a type of software testing which is performed to check the defects in software without actually executing the code of the software application.
Greybox Testing: Grey box testing is a type of software testing that includes black box and white box testing.
Component Testing: Component testing also known as program testing or module testing is a type of software testing that is done after the unit testing. In this, the test objects can be tested independently as a component without integrating with other components.",List and explain 5 types of Funtional Testing,"1) Unit Testing
i. With this functional testing type ,smallest functional and testable unit of code is tested during unit testing.
ii. Mostly, performed by developers, since it is a White-Box testing technique.

iii. Performed during the earliest stages of development, hence helps in uncovering defects during initial development phases.This helps in saving the higher cost of fixing the defects during the later stages of the STLC.

iv. Techniques used are:

Branch Coverage– All the logical paths and conditions (i.e. True and False), are covered during testing. E.g. for an If-Then-Else statement in the code, all branches of the path are If and Then conditions.
Statement Coverage– All the statements present in the function or module should be traversed at least once during the testing.
Boundary Value Analysis– The test data is created for the boundary values and also for the values that lie just before and just after the boundary value and then the test case is run using all the created datasets. e.g. Days of Month can have valid data from 1 to 31. So, valid boundary values are 1 and 31 but the test case will also be tested for 0 and 32 to test the invalid conditions as well.
Decision Coverage– During execution of Control Structures like “Do-While” or “Case statement” all decision paths are tested.
v. Tools Used for Unit Testing- Junit, Jtest, JMockit, NUnit etc.

2) Integration Testing
i. Two or more unit tested components of the software are integrated together, and tested to validate the interaction between them is as expected.

ii. The communication of commands, data, DB calls, API calls, Micro-services processing is happening between the units and there is no unexpected behaviour observed during this integration.

iii. Types of Integration Testing

Incremental – One or more components are combined and tested, once successfully tested more components are combined and tested. The process continues until the whole system is successfully tested.
There can be three approaches for Incremental Integration Testing:

1. Top-Down Approach: Modules from the top level of either control flow or according to the system design are tested first and the low level of modules are integrated incrementally. If a low-level module is not available, a stub is used.

2. Bottom-Up Approach: Reverse of Top-Down approach, low-level modules are tested first and then high-level modules are added incrementally. If a high-level module is not available, a driver is used.

3. Hybrid Approach: Combination of Top-Down and Bottom-Up approach. Testing starts at both the levels and converges at the middle level.

Big-Bang- All of the components are integrated and tested as a whole system, just like a big bang!
3) Interface Testing
i. A part of integration testing; the correctness of data exchange, data transfer, messages, calls and commands between two integrated components are tested.

ii. Communication between database, web-services, APIs or any external component and the application is tested during Interface Testing.

iii.  There should not be any error or format mismatch during this data or command communication. If any such problem is encountered, that needs to be corrected.

iv. Interface testing is the testing of the communication between different interfaces, while Integration Testing is the testing of the integrated group of modules as a single unit.

4) System Testing
i. All components of the system are combined and the system is tested for compliance and correctness against the requirement specifications (Functional or System).

ii. It is a Black-Box testing technique which validates the integrated system.

iii. It is performed before the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) in STLC(Software Testing Life Cycle).
iv. System Testing is performed in an almost real-life environment and according to real-life usage.

5) Regression Testing
i. After some enhancements or code fixes by developers, it becomes very important to run the regression test suite. Regression is run to ensure that these code changes have not hampered the existing working functionalities or any new defect is not injected in the code.

ii. Regression test cases are the subset of existing Functional Tests, which cover the major functionalities of the system.

iii. Regression cases need to be updated, added and deleted according to the application changes.

iv. The Regression test Cases are the best candidates for automation testing because they are run often and require time for execution.

v. Regression test cases to be run can be selected in 3 ways below:

 Run the whole regression test suite
Select the high priority test cases from regression suite
Select cases from regression suite testing the functionalities related to the code changes. 
Regression Testing is a pretty big concept in itself. To read more in detail about regression testing, please checkout the guide here: Regression Testing: Challenges, Strategies, and Best Practices

If you are at a stage where you find yourself spending too much time in executing the same regression test cases multiple times in a short duration, then you need to start thinking about automation. If you are not sure if you need to take up automation, this article can help : Why Automate Regression Testing in Accelerated Agile Delivery Cycles
6) Smoke Testing
i. After development, when a new build is released, Smoke Testing is performed on the application to ensure that all end-to-end major functionalities work.

ii. Smoke testing is usually done for the builds created during the initial phase of development for an application, which are not yet stable.

iii. During testing, if any major functionality is not working as expected then that particular build is rejected. Developers need to fix the bugs and create a new build for further testing.

iv. After successful Smoke Testing, the application is ready for the next level of testing. 

7) Sanity Testing
i. Sanity Tests are selected from the Regression Test suite, covering major functionalities of the application.

ii. Sanity Testing is done on the new build created by developers for a relatively stable application.

iii. When an application successfully passes the Sanity Testing, it is ready for the next level of testing.

iv. It is easy to be confused between smoke and sanity testing. To test an initial application after a new build, Smoke Testing is performed. After many releases, once it has gained stability, Sanity Testing is performed on the same application.

 Differences between smoke testing, sanity testing and regression testing are mentioned in detail here.
8) Acceptance Testing
i. During Acceptance Testing, the acceptance of the application by the end-user is tested. Aim of this testing is to make sure that the developed system fulfils all the requirements that were agreed upon during the business requirement creation.
ii. It is performed just after the System Testing and before the final release of the application in the real world.

iii. Acceptance testing becomes a criterion for the user to either accept or reject the system.

iv. It is a Black-Box testing technique because we are only interested in knowing the application’s readiness for the market and real users.

v. Types of Acceptance Testing

a) User Acceptance Testing

Alpha Testing- Performed at the developer’s site by skilled testers.
Beta Testing- Performed at the client site by real users.
b) Business Acceptance Testing

Business Acceptance Testing is done to ensure that the application is able to meet business requirements and goals.

c) Regulation Acceptance Testing

Regulation Acceptance Testing is done to ensure that the developed application does not violate any legal regulations put in place by the governing bodies.

2,"Performance Testing is a type of software testing that ensures software applications perform properly under their expected workload. It is a testing technique carried out to determine system performance in terms of sensitivity, reactivity, and stability under a particular workload. 

Performance testing is a type of software testing that focuses on evaluating the performance and scalability of a system or application. The goal of performance testing is to identify bottlenecks, measure system performance under various loads and conditions, and ensure that the system can handle the expected number of users or transactions.",Explain PerformanceTesting,"Performance Testing is a type of software testing that ensures software applications perform properly under their expected workload. It is a testing technique carried out to determine system performance in terms of sensitivity, reactivity, and stability under a particular workload. ","Performance testing is a non-functional software testing technique that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of an application holds up under a given workload",4,6
2,"Types of Performance Testing:

Load testing: 
It checks the product’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance congestion before the software product is launched in the market.
Stress testing: 
It involves testing a product under extreme workloads to see whether it handles high traffic or not. The objective is to identify the breaking point of a software product.
Endurance testing: 
It is performed to ensure the software can handle the expected load over a long period.
Spike testing: 
It tests the product’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.
Volume testing: 
In volume testing, large number of data is saved in a database and the overall software system’s behaviour is observed. The objective is to check the product’s performance under varying database volumes.
Scalability testing: 
In scalability testing, the software application’s effectiveness is determined by scaling up to support an increase in user load. It helps in planning capacity additions to your software system.",List and Explain the types of Performance Testing,"Load Testing
Load testing measures system performance as the workload increases. That workload could mean concurrent users or transactions. The system is monitored to measure response time and system staying power as workload increases. That workload falls within the parameters of normal working conditions.

Stress Testing
Unlike load testing, stress testing — also known as fatigue testing — is meant to measure system performance outside of the parameters of normal working conditions. The software is given more users or transactions that can be handled. The goal of stress testing is to measure the software stability. At what point does software fail, and how does the software recover from failure?

Spike Testing
Spike testing is a type of stress testing that evaluates software performance when workloads are substantially increased quickly and repeatedly. The workload is beyond normal expectations for short amounts of time.

Endurance Testing
Endurance testing — also known as soak testing — is an evaluation of how software performs with a normal workload over an extended amount of time. The goal of endurance testing is to check for system problems such as memory leaks. (A memory leak occurs when a system fails to release discarded memory. The memory leak can impair system performance or cause it to fail.)

Scalability Testing
Scalability testing is used to determine if software is effectively handling increasing workloads. This can be determined by gradually adding to the user load or data volume while monitoring system performance. Also, the workload may stay at the same level while resources such as CPUs and memory are changed.

Volume Testing
Volume testing determines how efficiently software performs with large projected amounts of data. It is also known as flood testing because the test floods the system with data.","Load testing – checks the application’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live.
Stress testing – involves testing an application under extreme workloads to see how it handles high traffic or data processing. The objective is to identify the breaking point of an application.
Endurance testing – is done to make sure the software can handle the expected load over a long period of time.
Spike testing – tests the software’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.
Volume testing – Under Volume Testing large no. of. Data is populated in a database, and the overall software system’s behavior is monitored. The objective is to check software application’s performance under varying database volumes.
Scalability testing – The objective of scalability testing is to determine the software application’s effectiveness in “scaling up” to support an increase in user load. It helps plan capacity addition to your software system.",4,5
2,"Features and Functionality supported by a software system are not the only concern. A software application’s performance, like its response time, reliability, resource usage, and scalability, do matter. The goal of Performance Testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks.

Performance Testing is done to provide stakeholders with information about their application regarding speed, stability, and scalability. More importantly, Performance Testing uncovers what needs to be improved before the product goes to market. Without Performance Testing, the software is likely to suffer from issues such as: running slow while several users use it simultaneously, inconsistencies across different operating systems, and poor usability. Performance testing will determine whether their software meets speed, scalability, and stability requirements under expected workloads. Applications sent to market with poor performance metrics due to nonexistent or poor performance testing are likely to gain a bad reputation and fail to meet expected sales goals.",Why do Performance Testing?,"Performance testing helps identify and eliminate performance-related issues early in the development cycle, which reduces the time and cost of fixing them later. This allows developers to focus on other critical tasks, increasing productivity.","imagine you're working on a big school project, and you want to make sure everything runs smoothly. Performance testing is like checking your project as you go along to catch any issues early on. This is super helpful because fixing small problems now is much easier than trying to sort them out right before the project is due.

So, in the world of creating things (like software), performance testing is like making sure everything works well from the start. It's a bit like finding and fixing mistakes in your project so that you have more time to focus on other important stuff, making you more productive",3,5

1,"Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, and its importance can be attributed to several key reasons:

Quality of Input Data:

Machine learning models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Poor-quality data, which may contain errors, missing values, or outliers, can lead to inaccurate and unreliable models. Preprocessing helps in cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for training models.
Handling Missing Values:

Real-world datasets often have missing values due to various reasons such as sensor failures, data corruption, or human errors. Preprocessing involves strategies for handling missing data, such as imputation or removal of affected samples or features.
Dealing with Noisy Data:

Noise in the data can be introduced by outliers or irrelevant information. Outliers can significantly impact the training process and model performance. Data preprocessing techniques help in identifying and handling noisy data to improve the overall robustness of the model.
Normalization and Scaling:

Different features in a dataset may have different scales, and some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of input features. Normalization and scaling techniques (e.g., Min-Max scaling or z-score normalization) ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process, preventing some features from dominating others.
Handling Categorical Data:

Many machine learning algorithms require numerical input, but real-world data often includes categorical variables. Encoding categorical variables into a suitable format, such as one-hot encoding, is part of the preprocessing step.
Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the performance of the model. This process can include operations like polynomial feature expansion, log transformations, or creating interaction terms. Effective feature engineering can uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data.
Dimensionality Reduction:

High-dimensional datasets can suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computation time and overfitting. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be applied during preprocessing to retain essential information while reducing the number of features.
Ensuring Consistency:

Data from various sources may have inconsistencies in terms of format, units, or other properties. Preprocessing helps in standardizing and ensuring the consistency of data, making it compatible for training machine learning models.
Improving Model Performance:

Well-preprocessed data can lead to better model performance. By addressing issues like noise, outliers, and missing values, preprocessing contributes to the creation of more accurate and robust machine learning models.

Choosing the right data modeling technique ensures that your data warehouse is aligned with your organization's needs and delivers value to your business. In this blog post, we'll explore the key factors you need to consider when selecting a data modeling technique for your data warehouse.

Business Requirements
Understanding your organization's business requirements is the first step in selecting the right data modeling technique. You need to identify the problems your data warehouse needs to solve, the data you need to solve them, and your reporting and analysis requirements.

Data Volume and Velocity
Data volume and velocity are critical factors in determining the right data modeling technique. If you have a large volume of data or need to process data quickly, you may need a different technique than if you have a small volume of data or don't need to process it in real-time.

Data Complexity
The complexity of both the source data and the reporting/analytics system plays a crucial role in determining the appropriate approach. If your requirements involve numerous dimensions, hierarchies, large data volumes, dimensional calculations, and time series comparisons, opting for a proven modeling technique (link through to blog on choosing the right modeling technique) is recommended, which apply for a data warehouse or a data lakehouse, or similar. Additionally, the nature of the source data, including the need to unify disparate systems like ERP and CRM, as well as web analytics data, should influence your choice of a modeling technique that facilitates seamless integration with evolving data sources.  

Conversely, if your data source exhibits relatively straightforward structures with minimal dependencies, leveraging frontend technologies like Power BI, Qlik, or Tableau may suffice, requiring less data preparation and a formal data model. 

Data Integration
Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. The right data modeling technique should support data integration and enable you to combine data from multiple sources.

Scalability
Scalability is the ability of your data modeling technique to handle large volumes of data and increased processing requirements. You need to ensure that your chosen technique can scale as your business grows.

Flexibility
Flexibility is the ability to adapt to changes in your business requirements or data sources. Your data modeling technique should be flexible enough to accommodate changes in your organization's needs and data sources.

Cost
Cost is always a factor in selecting a data modeling technique. You need to consider the cost of development, maintenance, and licensing when choosing a technique.

Skills 
The skills and expertise of your team or resources are crucial for the success of your project. Data modeling necessitates a deep understanding of database concepts, data structures, and modeling methodologies. Proficiency in SQL, data modeling tools, and relevant programming languages is good to have.

Scikit-learn has implementations for grid search and random search and is a good place to start if you are building models with sklearn. 
For both of those methods, scikit-learn trains and evaluates a model in a k fold cross-validation setting over various parameter choices and returns the best model. 
Specifically:
•	Random search: with randomsearchcv runs the search over some number of random parameter combinations 
•	Grid search: gridsearchcv runs the search over all parameter sets in the grid
Tuning models with scikit-learn is a good start but there are better options out there and they often have random search strategies anyway. 
2. Scikit-optimize: Scikit-Optimize 
When working with a large number of parameters, the base algorithms of GridSearch and RandomSearch for hyperparameter tuning provided by the popular scikit-learn toolkit are not efficient. Instead, try working with the scikit-optimize library (also known as skopt), which uses a Bayesian optimization approach. 
Skopt can be used as a drop-in replacement for the GridSearchCV original optimizer that supports several models with different search spaces and numbers of evaluations (per model class) to be optimized.

7. Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian Optimization is a package designed to minimize the number of steps required to find a combination of parameters that are close to the optimal combination. 
This method uses a proxy optimization problem (finding the maximum of the acquisition function) which, although it’s still a hard problem, it’s cheaper in the computational sense, and common tools can be employed. Therefore, Bayesian Optimization is most adequate for situations where sampling the function to be optimized is a very expensive endeavor.  1. The Bayesian-Optimization Library
The bayesian-optimization library takes black box functions and: 


Optimizes them by creating a Gaussian process 
Balances the exploration in the search space, as well as the exploitation of results obtained from previous iterations. 
Allows you to dynamically pan and zoom the bounds of the problem to improve convergence. 
8. Metric Optimization Engine
MOE (Metric Optimization Engine) is an efficient way to optimize a system’s parameters when evaluating parameters is time-consuming or expensive.
It is ideal for problems in which 
•	the optimization problem’s objective function is a black box, not necessarily convex or concave, 
•	derivatives are unavailable, 
•	and we seek a global optimum, rather than just a local one. 
This ability to handle black-box objective functions allows us to use MOE to optimize nearly any system, without requiring any internal knowledge or access.

3. Decision Tree
Decision tree is supervised learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly this is ideally for solving Classification problems. It is a tree structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In decision tree, there are two modes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision Nodes are used for making any decision and have numerous branches, whereas Leaf Nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree
1.	It has three parts which are the nodes, edges and leaves.
2.	It is non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
3.	It classifies examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, with the leaf node providing the classification to the example.
4.	One of the basic algorithms used in decision tree is ID3
5.	SCIKIT-LEARN library is used to build decision learning model
Applications of Decision Tree:
1.	Face Recognition: Face recognition finds its applications in our smartphones and any other place with Biometric security. Face Recognition is nothing but face detection followed by classification. The classification algorithm determines if the face in the image matches with the registered user or not.
2.	Medical Image Classification: Given the data of patients, a model that is well trained is often used to classify if the patient has a malignant tumor (cancer), heart ailments, fractures, etc.
3.	Stock Market Prediction: Regression algorithms are used to predict the future price of stocks based on certain past features like time of the day or festival time, etc. Stock Market Prediction also falls under a subdomain of study called Time Series Analysis.
4.	Object Detection Algorithms: Object Detection is the process of detection of the location of a given object in an image or video. This process returns the coordinates of the pixel values stating the location of the object in the image. These coordinates are determined by using regression algorithms alongside classification.

SOLUTION
Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). Example: Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. . (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. More input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.

•	Feature selection. ...
•	Feature extraction. ...
•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ...
•	Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) ...

The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree
1.	It has three parts which are the nodes, edges and leaves.
2.	It is non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
3.	It classifies examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, with the leaf node providing the classification to the example.
4.	One of the basic algorithms used in decision tree is ID3
5.	SCIKIT-LEARN library is used to build decision learning model
Applications of Decision Tree:
1.	Face Recognition: Face recognition finds its applications in our smartphones and any other place with Biometric security. Face Recognition is nothing but face detection followed by classification. The classification algorithm determines if the face in the image matches with the registered user or not.
2.	Medical Image Classification: Given the data of patients, a model that is well trained is often used to classify if the patient has a malignant tumor (cancer), heart ailments, fractures, etc.
3.	Stock Market Prediction: Regression algorithms are used to predict the future price of stocks based on certain past features like time of the day or festival time, etc. Stock Market Prediction also falls under a subdomain of study called Time Series Analysis.
4.	Object Detection Algorithms: Object Detection is the process of detection of the location of a given object in an image or video. This process returns the coordinates of the pixel values stating the location of the object in the image. These coordinates are determined by using regression algorithms alongside classification.

Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). Example: Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. . (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. More input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.

Decision tree is supervised learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly this is ideally for solving Classification problems. It is a tree structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In decision tree, there are two modes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision Nodes are used for making any decision and have numerous branches, whereas Leaf Nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree
1.	It has three parts which are the nodes, edges and leaves.
2.	It is non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
3.	It classifies examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, with the leaf node providing the classification to the example.
4.	One of the basic algorithms used in decision tree is ID3
5.	SCIKIT-LEARN library is used to build decision learning model
Applications of Decision Tree:
1.	Face Recognition: Face recognition finds its applications in our smartphones and any other place with Biometric security. Face Recognition is nothing but face detection followed by classification. The classification algorithm determines if the face in the image matches with the registered user or not.
2.	Medical Image Classification: Given the data of patients, a model that is well trained is often used to classify if the patient has a malignant tumor (cancer), heart ailments, fractures, etc.
3.	Stock Market Prediction: Regression algorithms are used to predict the future price of stocks based on certain past features like time of the day or festival time, etc. Stock Market Prediction also falls under a subdomain of study called Time Series Analysis.
4.	Object Detection Algorithms: Object Detection is the process of detection of the location of a given object in an image or video. This process returns the coordinates of the pixel values stating the location of the object in the image. These coordinates are determined by using regression algorithms alongside classification.

Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables.

A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.
Neural Network can be used to approximate non-linear systems which makes it evidence based. Also, because it can approximate non-linear system, it can be applied to a lot of environment application because they are non-linear. Neural Network can be used for regression and classification but mostly for regression, meaning it can be used to estimate an unknown parameter from data already known.

FEATURES OF NN
1.	Simple Structure: It is optimal.
2.	Less Training Parameters: It isn’t hard to train as the training process is well understood
3.	Adaptable and Easy to Implement: It is just the sum of exponentials and one of the reasons it is adaptable is because it is easy to implement. It can be applied to different environment scenarios.

AREAS OF APPLICATION OF NN
There are many areas of application of CNN, however there are two main areas which are;
1.	Image Recognition
2.	Voice Analysis
3.	Medical Diagnosis
4.	Credit Rating
5.	Fraud detection

2.	Is faster and more efficient as compared to the neural network.
3.	Has very good parallel capabilities.
4.	Optimizes both continuous and discrete functions and also multi-objective problems.
5.	Provides a list of “good” solutions and not just a single solution.
6.	Always gets an answer to the problem, which gets better over the time.
7.	Useful when the search space is very large and there are a large number of parameters involved.

Applications of Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm has many applications in real world.
1.	Optimization: Genetic Algorithms are most commonly used in optimization problems wherein we have to maximize or minimize a given objective function value under a given set of constraints. 
2.	Economics: GA is also used to characterize various economic models like the cobweb model, game theory equilibrium resolution, asset pricing, etc.
3.	Neural Networks: GA is also used to train neural networks, particularly recurrent neural networks.
4.	Parallelization: GAs also have very good parallel capabilities, and prove to be very effective means in solving certain problems, and also provide a good area for research.
5.	Image Processing: GA is used for various digital image processing (DIP) tasks as well like dense pixel matching.
6.	Vehicle Routing Problems: With multiple soft time windows, multiple depots and a heterogeneous fleet.
7.	Scheduling Applications: GA is used to solve various scheduling problems as well, particularly the time tabling problem.
8.	Machine Learning: as already discussed, genetics-based machine learning (GBML) is a niche area in machine learning.
9.	Robot Trajectory Generation: GA have been used to plan the path which a robot arm takes by moving from one point to another.
10.	Parametric Design of Aircraft: GA have been used to design aircrafts by varying the parameters and evolving better solutions.
11.	DNA Analysis: GA have been used to determine the structure of DNA using spectrometric data about the sample.
12.	Multimodal Optimization: GA is obviously very good approaches for multimodal optimization in which we have to find multiple optimum solutions.
13.	Traveling salesman problem and its applications: GA have been used to solve the TSP, which is a well-known combinatorial problem using novel crossover and packing strategies.

Definition:
Classification is a supervised learning task in machine learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of instances based on their features.

Example:
Consider a spam email classifier. The task is to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). The features could include the presence of certain keywords, the sender's address, and other attributes. The algorithm learns from labeled examples to predict the class label of new, unseen emails.

Regression:
Definition:
Regression is also a supervised learning task, but instead of predicting categorical labels, it aims to predict continuous numerical values.

Example:
Suppose you are building a house price prediction model. The goal is to predict the price of a house based on features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc. The algorithm learns from historical data with known house prices to make predictions for new houses.

Dimensionality Reduction:
Definition:
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving its essential information. It is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with a large number of features, as it can improve computational efficiency and reduce the risk of overfitting.

Example:
Consider a dataset with numerous features describing a person, including age, income, education level, and more. Using dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), you can transform these features into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables while retaining the most important information. This reduced set of features can simplify analysis and modeling.",4,4

Here are some justifications for the limitations of expert systems:

Limited to Explicit Knowledge:

Expert systems rely on explicitly coded knowledge provided by human experts. They may struggle with knowledge that is tacit or hard to articulate, which is common in certain domains where intuition and experience play a significant role.
Lack of Common Sense Reasoning:

Expert systems often lack common sense reasoning abilities that humans naturally possess. They may not perform well in situations where implicit knowledge or contextual understanding is crucial.
Difficulty Handling Uncertainty:

Expert systems may struggle with uncertain or ambiguous information. Real-world scenarios often involve incomplete or imprecise data, and expert systems may not effectively handle uncertainty in decision-making.",4,4

1,"Model:

A model is a representation or abstraction of a real-world system, process, or phenomenon. In the context of machine learning, a model is a mathematical or computational representation that captures patterns, relationships, or behaviors present in data. Models are trained on data to learn these patterns and can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. Models can take various forms, including linear models, decision trees, neural networks, and more.

Algorithm:

An algorithm, on the other hand, is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules for solving a particular problem or performing a specific task. In the context of machine learning, an algorithm refers to the process or method used to train a model. It defines how the model learns from the training data, adjusts its parameters, and generalizes to make predictions on new data. Algorithms are the underlying procedures that guide the learning process and determine how a model is trained and updated.
",Distinguish between a Model and an Algorithm,"A “model” in machine learning is the output of a machine learning algorithm run on data.
A model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm.
The model is the “thing” that is saved after running a machine learning algorithm on training data and represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures required to make predictions   

While

An “algorithm” in machine learning is a procedure that is run on data to create a machine learning “model.”
Machine learning algorithms perform “pattern recognition.” Algorithms “learn” from data, or are “fit” on a dataset.	
Specifically, an algorithm is run on data to create a model.

1,"Learning in machine learning is divided broadly into four types such as statistical inference, learning techniques,  learning problem and hybrid learning. Deep learning and evolutionary learning have evolved as other classes of learning in machine learning in addition to the four categories earlier mentioned making the learning types six in classification. 
Each of these major classifications is given below with their subdivisions:
i. Statistical inference
Statistical inference denotes the method through which inferences are drawn from the model estimate. Inference is the attainment of a conclusion or choice. In machine learning both forms of inference are to fit a model and predict. Inferences may be used as a foundation for understanding how certain machine learning algorithms function or how certain learning issues can be dealt with.
These examples of learning under this category are transductive learning, in addition to inductive learning and deductive inference. 
ii. Learning techniques 
Many approaches are classified as learning techniques. Active learning, ensemble learning, online learning, transfer learning as well as multi-task learning are machine learning group referred to as learning techniques.
iii. Learning Problems
There are three basic categories of learning problems in machine learning. This can be classified under these three types like supervised learning, reinforcement, together with unsupervised learning
iv. Hybrid learning Problems
The borders between supervised and unsupervised learning are blurred, and numerous hybrid techniques are derived from every field of research. Hybrid Learning includes self-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning and Multi-Instance Learning.
v. Deep learning
Deep Learning (DL) is a ML variant that is extremely sophisticated which use more advanced approaches to solve tough issues. According to, deep leaning is decisive. DL includes neural networks (NN), a sort of algorithm patterned after the physical nature of human brain. NN appears as the fundamentally profound aspect of AI enquiry because they offer a far more accurate human brain simulation all the more so better than before. Deep learning designs can reach the latest accuracy, specificity and possibly higher performance compared with human beings. The use of a complete range of labeled data in addition to multi-faceted neural network architecture are trained for these approaches.
vi. Evolutionary learning 
Evolutionary learning uses evolutionary algorithms to tackle machine learning optimization issues and has led to positive results in many areas. Due to the heuristic character of the optimisation of evolution, however, most of the results thus far were experiential and without theoretical inclination. Evolutionary learning is highly regarded in the community of machine learning due to the weakness, which promotes sound theoretical methods. Evolutionary computation field involves the following major algorithms: differential evolution (DE), evolution strategy (ES), genetic algorithm (GA), genetic programming (GP) including evolutionary programming (EP) .",Explain any FOUR classifications of learning with their examples ,"Learning in machine learning is divided broadly into four types such as statistical inference, learning techniques,  learning problem and hybrid learning.

3,"Cost estimation models are some mathematical algorithms or parametric equations that are used to estimate the cost of a product or a project. Various techniques or models are available for cost estimation, also known as Cost Estimation Models as shown below: Empirical Estimation Technique – Empirical estimation is a technique or model in which empirically derived formulas are used for predicting the data that are a required and essential part of the software project planning step. These techniques are usually based on the data that is collected previously from a project and also based on some guesses, prior experience with the development of similar types of projects, and assumptions. It uses the size of the software to estimate the effort. In this technique, an educated guess of project parameters is made. Hence, these models are based on common sense. However, as there are many activities involved in empirical estimation techniques, this technique is formalized. For example Delphi technique and Expert Judgement technique.
Heuristic Technique – Heuristic word is derived from a Greek word that means “to discover”. The heuristic technique is a technique or model that is used for solving problems, learning, or discovery in the practical methods which are used for achieving immediate goals. These techniques are flexible and simple for taking quick decisions through shortcuts and good enough calculations, most probably when working with complex data. But the decisions that are made using this technique are necessary to be optimal. In this technique, the relationship among different project parameters is expressed using mathematical equations. The popular heuristic technique is given by Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO). This technique is also used to increase or speed up the analysis and investment decisions.
Analytical Estimation Technique – Analytical estimation is a type of technique that is used to measure work. In this technique, firstly the task is divided or broken down into its basic component operations or elements for analyzing. Second, if the standard time is available from some other source, then these sources are applied to each element or component of work. Third, if there is no such time available, then the work is estimated based on the experience of the work. In this technique, results are derived by making certain basic assumptions about the project. Hence, the analytical estimation technique has some scientific basis. Halstead’s software science is based on an analytical estimation model.
Other Cost Estimation Models are:
Function Point Analysis (FPA): This technique counts the number and complexity of functions that a piece of software can perform to determine how functional and sophisticated it is. The effort needed for development, testing and maintenance can be estimated using this model.
Putnam Model: This model is a parametric estimation model that estimates effort, time and faults by taking into account the size of the the programme, the expertise of the development team and other project-specific characteristics.
Price-to-Win Estimation: Often utilized in competitive bidding, this model is concerned with projecting the expenses associated with developing a particular software project in order to secure a contract. It involves looking at market dynamics and competitors.
Models Based on Machine Learning: Custom cost estimating models can be built using machine learning techniques including neural networks, regression analysis and decision trees. These models are based on past project data. These models are flexible enough to adjust to changing data and project-specific features.
Function Points Model (IFPUG): A standardized technique for gauging the functionality of software using function points is offered by the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG).

3,"Cost estimation models are some mathematical algorithms or parametric equations that are used to estimate the cost of a product or a project. Various techniques or models are available for cost estimation, also known as Cost Estimation Models as shown below: Empirical Estimation Technique – Empirical estimation is a technique or model in which empirically derived formulas are used for predicting the data that are a required and essential part of the software project planning step. These techniques are usually based on the data that is collected previously from a project and also based on some guesses, prior experience with the development of similar types of projects, and assumptions. It uses the size of the software to estimate the effort. In this technique, an educated guess of project parameters is made. Hence, these models are based on common sense. However, as there are many activities involved in empirical estimation techniques, this technique is formalized. For example Delphi technique and Expert Judgement technique.
Heuristic Technique – Heuristic word is derived from a Greek word that means “to discover”. The heuristic technique is a technique or model that is used for solving problems, learning, or discovery in the practical methods which are used for achieving immediate goals. These techniques are flexible and simple for taking quick decisions through shortcuts and good enough calculations, most probably when working with complex data. But the decisions that are made using this technique are necessary to be optimal. In this technique, the relationship among different project parameters is expressed using mathematical equations. The popular heuristic technique is given by Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO). This technique is also used to increase or speed up the analysis and investment decisions.
Analytical Estimation Technique – Analytical estimation is a type of technique that is used to measure work. In this technique, firstly the task is divided or broken down into its basic component operations or elements for analyzing. Second, if the standard time is available from some other source, then these sources are applied to each element or component of work. Third, if there is no such time available, then the work is estimated based on the experience of the work. In this technique, results are derived by making certain basic assumptions about the project. Hence, the analytical estimation technique has some scientific basis. Halstead’s software science is based on an analytical estimation model.
Other Cost Estimation Models are:
Function Point Analysis (FPA): This technique counts the number and complexity of functions that a piece of software can perform to determine how functional and sophisticated it is. The effort needed for development, testing and maintenance can be estimated using this model.
Putnam Model: This model is a parametric estimation model that estimates effort, time and faults by taking into account the size of the the programme, the expertise of the development team and other project-specific characteristics.
Price-to-Win Estimation: Often utilized in competitive bidding, this model is concerned with projecting the expenses associated with developing a particular software project in order to secure a contract. It involves looking at market dynamics and competitors.
Models Based on Machine Learning: Custom cost estimating models can be built using machine learning techniques including neural networks, regression analysis and decision trees. These models are based on past project data. These models are flexible enough to adjust to changing data and project-specific features.

Features explanation
Object Oriented
Ruby is purely object-oriented programming language. Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. Every code has their properties and actions. Ruby is influenced with Smalltalk language. Rules applying to objects applies to the entire Ruby.

Flexibility
Ruby is a flexible language as you can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish.

Mixins
Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.

Dynamic typing and Duck typing
Ruby is a dynamic programming language. Ruby programs are not compiled. All class, module and method definition are built by the code when it run.

Ruby variables are loosely typed language, which means any variable can hold any type of object. When a method is called on an object, Ruby only looks up at the name irrespective of the type of object. This is duck typing. It allows you to make classes that pretend to be other classes.

Variable constants
In Ruby, constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.",List FIVE features of Ruby language and explain any THREE,"Ruby Features:

Features explanation
Object Oriented
Ruby is purely object-oriented programming language. Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. Every code has their properties and actions. Ruby is influenced with Smalltalk language. Rules applying to objects applies to the entire Ruby.

Flexibility
Ruby is a flexible language as you can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish.

Mixins
Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.

Dynamic typing and Duck typing
Ruby is a dynamic programming language. Ruby programs are not compiled. All class, module and method definition are built by the code when it run.

Ruby variables are loosely typed language, which means any variable can hold any type of object. When a method is called on an object, Ruby only looks up at the name irrespective of the type of object. This is duck typing. It allows you to make classes that pretend to be other classes.

Variable constants
In Ruby, constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.",List FIVE features of Ruby language and explain any THREE,"Ruby Features:

4,"Features of C++
1.	Multi-paradigm language: It supports at least 7 different styles of programming
2.	General Purpose languages: It is used in developing, game, desktop, apps, operating systems etc.
3.	Speed: Performance is exceptional.
4.	Object-Oriented: It allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.
5.	Machine Independent: It is machine independent (it can be written on any operating system) but platform dependent (compiled on one operating system won’t run on another).
6.	Compiler-based: That is, C++ programs used to be compiled and their executed file is used to run it.
7.	Case sensitive
8.	Dynamic Memory Allocation: it allows us to allocate the memory of a variable or an array in run-time.
9.	Multithreading: it doesn’t contain any built-in support for multithreading applications, instead it relies entirely upon the os to supply this feature
10.	Mid-level programming languge: it is a programming languge that collects special features of high and low level language
11.	Rich Library: its library is full of in-built functions that save a huge amount of time in the software development phase. Hence, saves programming time and increase development speed.
12.	Recursion: Due to code reusability features, functions can be called within a function saving memory space by not rewriting codes.
Areas of applications
i.	Games: C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU intensive functions and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking. All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop the gaming systems as well as game development suites.
ii.	GUI Based application: C++ is used in developing desktop/GUI application e.g. Adobe, etc.
iii.	Database software: C++ is also used in written Database Management systems e.g. MySQL server
iv.	Operating System: C++ as a middle level language can be send in written an operating system, also because it is a strongly typed and fast programming language, it is ideal candidate for writing operating system.  e.g. Window OS, Linux OS
v.	Browser: Most browsers are written in C++ due to its fast performance e.g. Mozilla, Chrome, Tor etc.
vi.	Advanced Computation and graphics: C++ is useful in developing an application that requires high-performance image processing, real-time physical simulations, and mobile sensor applications that need high performance and speed. e.g. alias system
vii.	Banking Application: for banking applications that require multi-threading, concurrency, and high performance, C++ has been the best language due to it great performance. e.g. Infosys Finacle.
viii.	Cloud/Distributed system: C++ becomes a default choice for implementing such systems as it is close to the hardware and also provides multithreading support that can build concurrent applications and load tolerance.
ix.	Compilers: Compilers of various high-level programming languages are written in C++ because C++ is a middle-level language that is close to hardware and is able to program and manipulate the underlying hardware resources.
x.	Embedded system: Various embedded systems like smartwatches, medical equipment systems use C++ to program as it is closer to the hardware level and can provide a lot of low-level function calls when compared to the other high-level programming languages

o	Google ? Google file system, Google Chromium browser, and MapReduce large cluster data processing are all written in C++.
o	Mozilla ? Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird email chat client is both written using C++.
o	MySQL ? MySQL, an open source DBMS is written using C++.
o	Microsoft ? Many windows apps that you regularly use are written in C++.
o	Rockstar Games ? Almost all major game companies use C++ due to its sheer speed on bare metal. Many major game engines are fully written in C++ and leverage its speed and OOP capabilities.
o	MongoDB ? An open-source database, widely used as the back end store for web applications, as well as in large enterprises like Viacom and Disney.
o	Morgan Stanley ? They use it for a huge part of their financial modeling. The creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup works here.
Vulnerability: Can’t be used in Network programming, Most of the security vulnerabilities in C/C++ programs arise from poor or careless access of memory.

It is a high-level programming language designed for string manipulation and pattern matching. SNOBOL is known for its powerful string processing capabilities, making it well-suited for tasks involving text manipulation and analysis. Here are three examples of areas where SNOBOL has found applications:

Text Processing and Parsing:

SNOBOL is commonly used for tasks that involve processing and manipulating textual data. Its pattern-matching abilities make it effective for parsing and extracting information from strings. Applications include text analysis, data extraction from unstructured text, and natural language processing.
Symbolic Computing:

SNOBOL is often used in symbolic computing applications, where the manipulation of symbols and patterns is essential. This includes tasks such as symbolic mathematics, formal language processing, and the development of domain-specific languages for symbolic manipulation.
Pattern Matching in Bioinformatics:

SNOBOL's powerful pattern-matching features make it suitable for applications in bioinformatics, where DNA and protein sequence analysis often involves complex pattern matching.

1,"Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at Michigan State University, explained that AI can be categorized into four types, beginning with the task-specific intelligent systems in wide use today and progressing to sentient systems, which do not yet exist. The categories are as follows.

Type 1: Reactive machines. These AI systems have no memory and are task-specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on a chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.
Type 2: Limited memory. These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.
Type 3: Theory of mind. Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI systems to become integral members of human teams.
Type 4: Self-awareness. In this category, AI systems have a sense of self, which gives them consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their own current state. This type of AI does not yet exist.",What are the 4 types of artificial intelligence,"Type 1: Reactive Machines - These AI systems lack memory and are designed for specific tasks, exemplified by Deep Blue, the IBM chess program from the 1990s. Although capable of identifying chessboard pieces and making predictions, their lack of memory precludes them from using past experiences for future decision-making.

Type 2: Limited Memory - AI systems of this type possess memory, allowing them to leverage past experiences for future decisions. Examples include decision-making functions in self-driving cars.

It's important to note that AI with this level of self-awareness does not currently exist.","Type 1: Reactive Machines

Think of these like one-trick ponies. They can do one specific job really well, like playing chess (just like Deep Blue did in the '90s), but they can't remember past games or experiences. It's all about the task at hand.
Type 2: Limited Memory

These AI systems are a bit better. They can remember some stuff from the past, so when they're making decisions, they can use what they've learned before. For example, some parts of self-driving cars work this way—they remember past situations to drive better.
Type 3: Theory of Mind

Now, we're getting into AI that understands people a bit more. Think of it like a computer that can ""get"" human feelings. It might predict what you're going to do based on how you're feeling. This is important for AI to work well with humans on teams.
Type 4: Self-awareness

This is like the most advanced level. Imagine AI that not only understands what's happening around it but also knows itself. It's conscious, aware of its own state. But, here's the thing—this kind of AI doesn't exist yet. It's like a futuristic idea for now.",4,5

The categories are as follows.

Type 1: Reactive machines. These AI systems have no memory and are task-specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on a chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.
Type 2: Limited memory. These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.
Type 3: Theory of mind. Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI systems to become integral members of human teams.

1,"The ongoing success of applied AI and cognitive simulation, as described in the preceding sections of this article, seems assured. However, artificial general intelligence (AGI), or strong AI—that is, artificial intelligence that aims to duplicate human intellectual abilities—remains controversial and out of reach. Exaggerated claims of success, in professional journals as well as in the popular press, have damaged its reputation. At the present time even an embodied system displaying the overall intelligence of a cockroach is proving elusive, let alone a system that can rival a human being. The difficulty of scaling up AI’s modest achievements cannot be overstated. Decades of research in symbolic AI have failed to produce any firm evidence that a symbol system can manifest human levels of general intelligence; connectionists are unable to model the nervous systems of even the simplest invertebrates; and critics of nouvelle AI regard as simply mystical the view that high-level behaviours involving language understanding, planning, and reasoning will somehow emerge from the interaction of basic behaviours such as obstacle avoidance, gaze control, and object manipulation.

However, this lack of substantial progress may simply be testimony to the difficulty of AGI, not to its impossibility. Let us turn to the very idea of AGI. Can a computer possibly think? Noam Chomsky suggests that debating this question is pointless, for it is an essentially arbitrary decision whether to extend common usage of the word think to include machines. There is, Chomsky claims, no factual question as to whether any such decision is right or wrong—just as there is no question as to whether our decision to say that airplanes fly is right, or our decision not to say that ships swim is wrong. However, this seems to oversimplify matters. The important question is: Could it ever be appropriate to say that computers think and, if so, what conditions must a computer satisfy in order to be so described?

Some authors offer the Turing test as a definition of intelligence. However, Turing himself pointed out that a computer that ought to be described as intelligent might nevertheless fail his test if it were incapable of successfully imitating a human being. For example, ChatGPT continually invokes its status as a large language model and thus would be unlikely to pass the Turing test. If an intelligent entity can fail the test, then the test cannot function as a definition of intelligence. It is even questionable whether passing the test would actually show that a computer is intelligent, as the information theorist Claude Shannon and the AI pioneer John McCarthy pointed out in 1956. Shannon and McCarthy argued that in principle it is possible to design a machine containing a complete set of canned responses to all the questions that an interrogator could possibly ask during the fixed time span of the test. Like Parry, this machine would produce answers to the interviewer’s questions by looking up appropriate responses in a giant table. This objection seems to show that in principle a system with no intelligence at all could pass the Turing test.

In fact, AI has no real definition of intelligence to offer, not even in the subhuman case. Rats are intelligent, but what exactly must an artificial intelligence achieve before researchers can claim that it has reached rats’ level of success? In the absence of a reasonably precise criterion for when an artificial system counts as intelligent, there is no objective way of telling whether an AI research program has succeeded or failed. One result of AI’s failure to produce a satisfactory criterion of intelligence is that, whenever researchers achieve one of AI’s goals—for example, a program that can summarize newspaper articles or beat the world chess champion—critics are able to say, “That’s not intelligence!” Marvin Minsky’s response to the problem of defining intelligence is to maintain—like Turing before him—that intelligence is simply our name for any problem-solving mental process that we do not yet understand.

2,"Types of software testing
There are many different types of software tests, each with specific objectives and strategies:

Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.
Code review: Are an effective means to confirm that new and modified software is following an organization’s coding standards and adheres to its best practices.
Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.
Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.
Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.
Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.
Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.
Security testing: validate that your software is not open to hacker or other malicious types of vulnerabilities that could be exploited to deny access to your services or cause them to perform incorrectly.
Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.
Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.",List and explain the types of Software Testing,"Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.

2,"Unit tests are typically written by developers as they write the code for a given unit. They are usually written in the same programming language as the software and use a testing framework or library that provides the necessary tools for creating and running the tests. These frameworks often include assertion libraries, which allow developers to write test cases that check the output of a given unit against expected results. The tests are usually run automatically and continuously as part of the software build process, and the results are typically displayed in a test runner or a continuous integration tool.

Unit testing has several benefits, including:

Early detection and isolation of defects, which can save time and money by allowing developers to fix errors before they become more costly to fix.
Improved software quality and maintainability, as unit tests help to ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality.
Increased developer confidence, as developers can make changes to the code with the knowledge that any errors will be caught by the unit tests.
Facilitation of test-driven development, a software development methodology in which tests are written before code is written, ensuring that code is written to meet the requirements.

i. With this functional testing type ,smallest functional and testable unit of code is tested during unit testing.
ii. Mostly, performed by developers, since it is a White-Box testing technique.

iii. Performed during the earliest stages of development, hence helps in uncovering defects during initial development phases.This helps in saving the higher cost of fixing the defects during the later stages of the STLC.

iv. Techniques used are:

Branch Coverage– All the logical paths and conditions (i.e. True and False), are covered during testing. E.g. for an If-Then-Else statement in the code, all branches of the path are If and Then conditions.
Statement Coverage– All the statements present in the function or module should be traversed at least once during the testing.
Boundary Value Analysis– The test data is created for the boundary values and also for the values that lie just before and just after the boundary value and then the test case is run using all the created datasets. e.g. Days of Month can have valid data from 1 to 31. So, valid boundary values are 1 and 31 but the test case will also be tested for 0 and 32 to test the invalid conditions as well.
Decision Coverage– During execution of Control Structures like “Do-While” or “Case statement” all decision paths are tested.
v. Tools Used for Unit Testing- Junit, Jtest, JMockit, NUnit etc.

2) Integration Testing
i. Two or more unit tested components of the software are integrated together, and tested to validate the interaction between them is as expected.

ii. The communication of commands, data, DB calls, API calls, Micro-services processing is happening between the units and there is no unexpected behaviour observed during this integration.

iii. Types of Integration Testing

Incremental – One or more components are combined and tested, once successfully tested more components are combined and tested. The process continues until the whole system is successfully tested.
There can be three approaches for Incremental Integration Testing:

1. Top-Down Approach: Modules from the top level of either control flow or according to the system design are tested first and the low level of modules are integrated incrementally. If a low-level module is not available, a stub is used.

2. Bottom-Up Approach: Reverse of Top-Down approach, low-level modules are tested first and then high-level modules are added incrementally. If a high-level module is not available, a driver is used.

3. Hybrid Approach: Combination of Top-Down and Bottom-Up approach. Testing starts at both the levels and converges at the middle level.

Big-Bang- All of the components are integrated and tested as a whole system, just like a big bang!
3) Interface Testing
i. A part of integration testing; the correctness of data exchange, data transfer, messages, calls and commands between two integrated components are tested.

ii. Communication between database, web-services, APIs or any external component and the application is tested during Interface Testing.

iii.  There should not be any error or format mismatch during this data or command communication. If any such problem is encountered, that needs to be corrected.

iv. Interface testing is the testing of the communication between different interfaces, while Integration Testing is the testing of the integrated group of modules as a single unit.

4) System Testing
i. All components of the system are combined and the system is tested for compliance and correctness against the requirement specifications (Functional or System).

ii. It is a Black-Box testing technique which validates the integrated system.

iii. It is performed before the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) in STLC(Software Testing Life Cycle).
iv. System Testing is performed in an almost real-life environment and according to real-life usage.

5) Regression Testing
i. After some enhancements or code fixes by developers, it becomes very important to run the regression test suite. Regression is run to ensure that these code changes have not hampered the existing working functionalities or any new defect is not injected in the code.

ii. Regression test cases are the subset of existing Functional Tests, which cover the major functionalities of the system.

iii. Regression cases need to be updated, added and deleted according to the application changes.

iv. The Regression test Cases are the best candidates for automation testing because they are run often and require time for execution.

v. Regression test cases to be run can be selected in 3 ways below:

 Run the whole regression test suite
Select the high priority test cases from regression suite
Select cases from regression suite testing the functionalities related to the code changes. 
Regression Testing is a pretty big concept in itself. To read more in detail about regression testing, please checkout the guide here: Regression Testing: Challenges, Strategies, and Best Practices

If you are at a stage where you find yourself spending too much time in executing the same regression test cases multiple times in a short duration, then you need to start thinking about automation. If you are not sure if you need to take up automation, this article can help : Why Automate Regression Testing in Accelerated Agile Delivery Cycles
6) Smoke Testing
i. After development, when a new build is released, Smoke Testing is performed on the application to ensure that all end-to-end major functionalities work.

ii. Smoke testing is usually done for the builds created during the initial phase of development for an application, which are not yet stable.

iii. During testing, if any major functionality is not working as expected then that particular build is rejected. Developers need to fix the bugs and create a new build for further testing.

iv. After successful Smoke Testing, the application is ready for the next level of testing. 

7) Sanity Testing
i. Sanity Tests are selected from the Regression Test suite, covering major functionalities of the application.

ii. Sanity Testing is done on the new build created by developers for a relatively stable application.

iii. When an application successfully passes the Sanity Testing, it is ready for the next level of testing.

iv. It is easy to be confused between smoke and sanity testing. To test an initial application after a new build, Smoke Testing is performed. After many releases, once it has gained stability, Sanity Testing is performed on the same application.

 Differences between smoke testing, sanity testing and regression testing are mentioned in detail here.
8) Acceptance Testing
i. During Acceptance Testing, the acceptance of the application by the end-user is tested. Aim of this testing is to make sure that the developed system fulfils all the requirements that were agreed upon during the business requirement creation.
ii. It is performed just after the System Testing and before the final release of the application in the real world.

iii. Acceptance testing becomes a criterion for the user to either accept or reject the system.

iv. It is a Black-Box testing technique because we are only interested in knowing the application’s readiness for the market and real users.

v. Types of Acceptance Testing

a) User Acceptance Testing

Alpha Testing- Performed at the developer’s site by skilled testers.
Beta Testing- Performed at the client site by real users.
b) Business Acceptance Testing

Business Acceptance Testing is done to ensure that the application is able to meet business requirements and goals.

c) Regulation Acceptance Testing

Regulation Acceptance Testing is done to ensure that the developed application does not violate any legal regulations put in place by the governing bodies.  
","1) Unit Testing
i. With this functional testing type ,smallest functional and testable unit of code is tested during unit testing. 2) Integration Testing
i. Two or more unit tested components of the software are integrated together, and tested to validate the interaction between them is as expected. 3) Interface Testing
i. A part of integration testing; the correctness of data exchange, data transfer, messages, calls and commands between two integrated components are tested. 4) System Testing
i. All components of the system are combined and the system is tested for compliance and correctness against the requirement specifications (Functional or System). 5) Regression Testing
i. After some enhancements or code fixes by developers, it becomes very important to run the regression test suite.",4,5
2,"Performance Testing is a type of software testing that ensures software applications perform properly under their expected workload. It is a testing technique carried out to determine system performance in terms of sensitivity, reactivity, and stability under a particular workload. 

Performance testing is a type of software testing that focuses on evaluating the performance and scalability of a system or application. The goal of performance testing is to identify bottlenecks, measure system performance under various loads and conditions, and ensure that the system can handle the expected number of users or transactions.",Explain PerformanceTesting,"Performance Testing is a type of software testing that ensures software applications perform properly under their expected workload. It is a testing technique carried out to determine system performance in terms of sensitivity, reactivity, and stability under a particular workload. ","Performance testing is a non-functional software testing technique that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of an application holds up under a given workload",4,6
2,"Types of Performance Testing:

Load testing: 
It checks the product’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance congestion before the software product is launched in the market.
Stress testing: 
It involves testing a product under extreme workloads to see whether it handles high traffic or not. The objective is to identify the breaking point of a software product.
Endurance testing: 
It is performed to ensure the software can handle the expected load over a long period.
Spike testing: 
It tests the product’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.
Volume testing: 
In volume testing, large number of data is saved in a database and the overall software system’s behaviour is observed. The objective is to check the product’s performance under varying database volumes.
Scalability testing: 
In scalability testing, the software application’s effectiveness is determined by scaling up to support an increase in user load. It helps in planning capacity additions to your software system.",List and Explain the types of Performance Testing,"Load Testing
Load testing measures system performance as the workload increases. That workload could mean concurrent users or transactions. The system is monitored to measure response time and system staying power as workload increases. That workload falls within the parameters of normal working conditions.

Stress Testing
Unlike load testing, stress testing — also known as fatigue testing — is meant to measure system performance outside of the parameters of normal working conditions. The software is given more users or transactions that can be handled. The goal of stress testing is to measure the software stability. At what point does software fail, and how does the software recover from failure?

Spike Testing
Spike testing is a type of stress testing that evaluates software performance when workloads are substantially increased quickly and repeatedly. The workload is beyond normal expectations for short amounts of time.

Endurance Testing
Endurance testing — also known as soak testing — is an evaluation of how software performs with a normal workload over an extended amount of time. The goal of endurance testing is to check for system problems such as memory leaks. (A memory leak occurs when a system fails to release discarded memory. The memory leak can impair system performance or cause it to fail.)

Scalability Testing
Scalability testing is used to determine if software is effectively handling increasing workloads. This can be determined by gradually adding to the user load or data volume while monitoring system performance. Also, the workload may stay at the same level while resources such as CPUs and memory are changed.

Volume Testing
Volume testing determines how efficiently software performs with large projected amounts of data. It is also known as flood testing because the test floods the system with data.","Load testing – checks the application’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live.
Stress testing – involves testing an application under extreme workloads to see how it handles high traffic or data processing. The objective is to identify the breaking point of an application.
Endurance testing – is done to make sure the software can handle the expected load over a long period of time.
Spike testing – tests the software’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.
Volume testing – Under Volume Testing large no. of. Data is populated in a database, and the overall software system’s behavior is monitored. The objective is to check software application’s performance under varying database volumes.
Scalability testing – The objective of scalability testing is to determine the software application’s effectiveness in “scaling up” to support an increase in user load. It helps plan capacity addition to your software system.",4,5
2,"Features and Functionality supported by a software system are not the only concern. A software application’s performance, like its response time, reliability, resource usage, and scalability, do matter. The goal of Performance Testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks.

Performance Testing is done to provide stakeholders with information about their application regarding speed, stability, and scalability. More importantly, Performance Testing uncovers what needs to be improved before the product goes to market. Without Performance Testing, the software is likely to suffer from issues such as: running slow while several users use it simultaneously, inconsistencies across different operating systems, and poor usability. Performance testing will determine whether their software meets speed, scalability, and stability requirements under expected workloads. Applications sent to market with poor performance metrics due to nonexistent or poor performance testing are likely to gain a bad reputation and fail to meet expected sales goals.",Why do Performance Testing?,"Performance testing helps identify and eliminate performance-related issues early in the development cycle, which reduces the time and cost of fixing them later. This allows developers to focus on other critical tasks, increasing productivity.","imagine you're working on a big school project, and you want to make sure everything runs smoothly. Performance testing is like checking your project as you go along to catch any issues early on. This is super helpful because fixing small problems now is much easier than trying to sort them out right before the project is due.

So, in the world of creating things (like software), performance testing is like making sure everything works well from the start. It's a bit like finding and fixing mistakes in your project so that you have more time to focus on other important stuff, making you more productive",3,5

1,"Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, and its importance can be attributed to several key reasons:

Quality of Input Data:

Machine learning models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Poor-quality data, which may contain errors, missing values, or outliers, can lead to inaccurate and unreliable models. Preprocessing helps in cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for training models.
Handling Missing Values:

Real-world datasets often have missing values due to various reasons such as sensor failures, data corruption, or human errors. Preprocessing involves strategies for handling missing data, such as imputation or removal of affected samples or features.
Dealing with Noisy Data:

Noise in the data can be introduced by outliers or irrelevant information. Outliers can significantly impact the training process and model performance. Data preprocessing techniques help in identifying and handling noisy data to improve the overall robustness of the model.
Normalization and Scaling:

Different features in a dataset may have different scales, and some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of input features. Normalization and scaling techniques (e.g., Min-Max scaling or z-score normalization) ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process, preventing some features from dominating others.
Handling Categorical Data:

Many machine learning algorithms require numerical input, but real-world data often includes categorical variables. Encoding categorical variables into a suitable format, such as one-hot encoding, is part of the preprocessing step.
Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the performance of the model. This process can include operations like polynomial feature expansion, log transformations, or creating interaction terms. Effective feature engineering can uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data.
Dimensionality Reduction:

High-dimensional datasets can suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computation time and overfitting. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be applied during preprocessing to retain essential information while reducing the number of features.
Ensuring Consistency:

Data from various sources may have inconsistencies in terms of format, units, or other properties. Preprocessing helps in standardizing and ensuring the consistency of data, making it compatible for training machine learning models.
Improving Model Performance:

Well-preprocessed data can lead to better model performance. By addressing issues like noise, outliers, and missing values, preprocessing contributes to the creation of more accurate and robust machine learning models.
In summary, data preprocessing plays a crucial role in preparing raw data for machine learning tasks, ensuring that models can learn effectively and make reliable predictions on new, unseen data.",Why is Data Preprocessing important in Machine Learning?,Data Preprocessing of data is mainly to check the data quality,"Data preprocessing is a required first step before any machine learning machinery can be applied, because the algorithms learn from the data and the learning outcome for problem solving heavily depends on the proper data needed to solve a particular problem – which are called features.",1,1

For both of those methods, scikit-learn trains and evaluates a model in a k fold cross-validation setting over various parameter choices and returns the best model. 
Specifically:
•	Random search: with randomsearchcv runs the search over some number of random parameter combinations 
•	Grid search: gridsearchcv runs the search over all parameter sets in the grid
Tuning models with scikit-learn is a good start but there are better options out there and they often have random search strategies anyway.

When working with a large number of parameters, the base algorithms of GridSearch and RandomSearch for hyperparameter tuning provided by the popular scikit-learn toolkit are not efficient. Instead, try working with the scikit-optimize library (also known as skopt), which uses a Bayesian optimization approach. 
Skopt can be used as a drop-in replacement for the GridSearchCV original optimizer that supports several models with different search spaces and numbers of evaluations (per model class) to be optimized. Skopt also includes utilities for comparing and visualizing the partial results of distinct optimization algorithms, which makes it a great companion to the standard scikit-learn modeling workflow.

12.	Fabolas 1. Scikit-learn 
Scikit-learn has implementations for grid search and random search and is a good place to start if you are building models with sklearn. 
For both of those methods, scikit-learn trains and evaluates a model in a k fold cross-validation setting over various parameter choices and returns the best model. 
Specifically:
•	Random search: with randomsearchcv runs the search over some number of random parameter combinations 
•	Grid search: gridsearchcv runs the search over all parameter sets in the grid
Tuning models with scikit-learn is a good start but there are better options out there and they often have random search strategies anyway. 
2. Scikit-optimize: Scikit-Optimize 
When working with a large number of parameters, the base algorithms of GridSearch and RandomSearch for hyperparameter tuning provided by the popular scikit-learn toolkit are not efficient. Instead, try working with the scikit-optimize library (also known as skopt), which uses a Bayesian optimization approach. 
Skopt can be used as a drop-in replacement for the GridSearchCV original optimizer that supports several models with different search spaces and numbers of evaluations (per model class) to be optimized. Skopt also includes utilities for comparing and visualizing the partial results of distinct optimization algorithms, which makes it a great companion to the standard scikit-learn modeling workflow. However, its narrow scope leaves out other ML frameworks, which is its main drawback. 
Scikit-optimize uses a Sequential model-based optimization algorithm to find optimal solutions for hyperparameter search problems in less time.
Scikit-optimize provides many features other than hyperparameter optimization such as: 
•	store and load optimization results,
•	convergence plots, 
•	comparing surrogate models
3. Optuna
Optuna uses a historical record of trails details to determine the promising area to search for optimizing the hyperparameter and hence finds the optimal hyperparameter in a minimum amount of time. 
It has the pruning feature which automatically stops the unpromising trails in the early stages of training. Some of the key features provided by optuna are:
•	Lightweight, versatile, and platform-agnostic architecture
•	Pythonic search spaces
•	Efficient optimization algorithms
•	Easy parallelization
•	Quick visualization
4. Hyperopt
Hyperopt is one of the most popular hyperparameter tuning packages available. Hyperopt allows the user to describe a search space in which the user expects the best results allowing the algorithms in hyperopt to search more efficiently. 
Currently, three algorithms are implemented in hyperopt.
•	Random Search
•	Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE)
•	Adaptive TPE
5. Ray Tune
Ray Tune is a popular choice of experimentation and hyperparameter tuning at any scale. Ray uses the power of distributed computing to speed up hyperparameter optimization and has an implementation for several states of the art optimization algorithms at scale. 
Some of the core features provided by ray tune are:
•	distributed asynchronous optimization out of the box by leveraging Ray.
•	Easily scalable.
•	Provided SOTA algorithms such as ASHA, BOHB, and Population-Based Training.
•	Supports Tensorboard and MLflow.
•	Supports a variety of frameworks such Sklearn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.
6. Keras Tuner
Keras Tuner is a library that helps you pick the optimal set of hyperparameters for your TensorFlow program. When you build a model for hyperparameter tuning, you also define the hyperparameter search space in addition to the model architecture. The model you set up for hyperparameter tuning is called a hypermodel.
You can define a hypermodel through two approaches:
•	By using a model builder function
•	By subclassing the HyperModel class of the Keras Tuner API
7. Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian Optimization is a package designed to minimize the number of steps required to find a combination of parameters that are close to the optimal combination. 
This method uses a proxy optimization problem (finding the maximum of the acquisition function) which, although it’s still a hard problem, it’s cheaper in the computational sense, and common tools can be employed. Therefore, Bayesian Optimization is most adequate for situations where sampling the function to be optimized is a very expensive endeavor.  1. The Bayesian-Optimization Library
The bayesian-optimization library takes black box functions and: 


Optimizes them by creating a Gaussian process 
Balances the exploration in the search space, as well as the exploitation of results obtained from previous iterations. 
Allows you to dynamically pan and zoom the bounds of the problem to improve convergence. 
8. Metric Optimization Engine
MOE (Metric Optimization Engine) is an efficient way to optimize a system’s parameters when evaluating parameters is time-consuming or expensive.
It is ideal for problems in which 
•	the optimization problem’s objective function is a black box, not necessarily convex or concave, 
•	derivatives are unavailable, 
•	and we seek a global optimum, rather than just a local one. 
This ability to handle black-box objective functions allows us to use MOE to optimize nearly any system, without requiring any internal knowledge or access. 
9. Spearmint
Spearmint is a software package that also performs Bayesian optimization. The software is designed to automatically run experiments (thus the code name spearmint) in a manner that iteratively adjusts a number of parameters so as to minimize some objectives in as few runs as possible. 
10. GPyOpt
GPyOpt is Gaussian process optimization using GPy. It performs global optimization with different acquisition functions. 
Among other functionalities, it is possible to use GPyOpt to optimize physical experiments (sequentially or in batches) and tune the parameters of Machine Learning algorithms. It is able to handle large data sets via sparse Gaussian process models.
11. SigOpt
SigOpt fully integrates automated hyperparameter tuning with training runs tracking to give you a sense of the bigger picture and the path to reach your best model. 
With features like highly customizable search spaces and multimetric optimization, SigOpt can advance your model with a simple API for sophisticated hyperparameter tuning before taking it into production.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics that poses a hypothetical scenario in which a person is required to make a choice between two negative outcomes.
Using the four paradigms to solve the problem:
•	Think Humanly
When thinking humanly the Artificial Intelligence tried to understand and model how the human mind works, it tries to emulate activities that are associate to human thinking, activities such as decision making, problem solving, learning. Etc.

	In the question, we are presented with a scenario similar to the trolley problem, it has to make the decision of whether to go on path A which has the baby on it, or go through path B with the elderly woman. If the machine was to think humanly, it would hit the old woman and save the baby or come to an halt to save both the baby and the old woman.

1,"1. Neural Network (NN)
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.
Neural Network can be used to approximate non-linear systems which makes it evidence based. Also, because it can approximate non-linear system, it can be applied to a lot of environment application because they are non-linear. Neural Network can be used for regression and classification but mostly for regression, meaning it can be used to estimate an unknown parameter from data already known.

FEATURES OF NN

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection. It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime to solve. It is frequently used to solve optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
Features of Genetic Algorithm
1.	Does not require any derivative information (which may not be available for many real-world problems).
2.	Is faster and more efficient as compared to the neural network.
3.	Has very good parallel capabilities.
4.	Optimizes both continuous and discrete functions and also multi-objective problems.
5.	Provides a list of “good” solutions and not just a single solution.
6.	Always gets an answer to the problem, which gets better over the time.
7.	Useful when the search space is very large and there are a large number of parameters involved.

Applications of Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm has many applications in real world.

3. Decision Tree
Decision tree is supervised learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly this is ideally for solving Classification problems. It is a tree structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In decision tree, there are two modes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision Nodes are used for making any decision and have numerous branches, whereas Leaf Nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree

The classification algorithm determines if the face in the image matches with the registered user or not.
2.	Medical Image Classification: Given the data of patients, a model that is well trained is often used to classify if the patient has a malignant tumor (cancer), heart ailments, fractures, etc.
3.	Stock Market Prediction: Regression algorithms are used to predict the future price of stocks based on certain past features like time of the day or festival time, etc. Stock Market Prediction also falls under a subdomain of study called Time Series Analysis.

Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). Example: Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. . (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)

Decision tree is supervised learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly this is ideally for solving Classification problems. It is a tree structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In decision tree, there are two modes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision Nodes are used for making any decision and have numerous branches, whereas Leaf Nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. The decision or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
Features of Decision Tree

SOLUTION
Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)
Regression technique is a predictive modelling technique used in investigating the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc. The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y). Example: Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. . (1 mark for explanation, ½ mark for example, total = 1.5 Marks)

Definition:
Classification is a supervised learning task in machine learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of instances based on their features.

Example:
Consider a spam email classifier. The task is to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). The features could include the presence of certain keywords, the sender's address, and other attributes. The algorithm learns from labeled examples to predict the class label of new, unseen emails.

Regression:
Definition:
Regression is also a supervised learning task, but instead of predicting categorical labels, it aims to predict continuous numerical values.

Example:
Suppose you are building a house price prediction model. The goal is to predict the price of a house based on features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc. The algorithm learns from historical data with known house prices to make predictions for new houses.

Dimensionality Reduction:
Definition:
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving its essential information. It is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with a large number of features, as it can improve computational efficiency and reduce the risk of overfitting.

Example:
Consider a dataset with numerous features describing a person, including age, income, education level, and more. Using dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), you can transform these features into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables while retaining the most important information. This reduced set of features can simplify analysis and modeling.",4,4

Here are some justifications for the limitations of expert systems:

Limited to Explicit Knowledge:

Expert systems rely on explicitly coded knowledge provided by human experts. They may struggle with knowledge that is tacit or hard to articulate, which is common in certain domains where intuition and experience play a significant role.
Lack of Common Sense Reasoning:

Expert systems often lack common sense reasoning abilities that humans naturally possess. They may not perform well in situations where implicit knowledge or contextual understanding is crucial.
Difficulty Handling Uncertainty:

Expert systems may struggle with uncertain or ambiguous information. Real-world scenarios often involve incomplete or imprecise data, and expert systems may not effectively handle uncertainty in decision-making.",4,4

In order to contextualize, externalize and interpret the knowledge, there is a need to address eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and eXplainable Cognitive Intelligence (XCI). Examples of interactive AI are chatbots and smart personal assistants. Interactive AI is a type of AI in modern business that allows automation of communication without interactivity compromise. Smart personal assistants and Chatbots are used to visualize interactive AI because they have capacities that can vary from replying pre-built questions to understanding the conversation framework. Interactive AI can also be used in improving a company’s interior procedures. The Figure below shows the various types of artificial intelligence.

Functional AI is very similar to analytic AI.  Enormous quantities of data are needed for scanning and locating patterns as well as dependencies. However, functional AI jumps into action instead of giving references. For instance, functional AI can identify a machine-breakdown patterns in the device data received from a confident machine and a command is generated to turn off this machine because of being the part of the IoT cloud.  Another example: robots being used by Amazon to bring the tables with the items on it to the pickers, during this process the picking process is being speed up.

1,"Model:

A model is a representation or abstraction of a real-world system, process, or phenomenon. In the context of machine learning, a model is a mathematical or computational representation that captures patterns, relationships, or behaviors present in data. Models are trained on data to learn these patterns and can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. Models can take various forms, including linear models, decision trees, neural networks, and more.

Algorithm:

An algorithm, on the other hand, is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules for solving a particular problem or performing a specific task. In the context of machine learning, an algorithm refers to the process or method used to train a model. It defines how the model learns from the training data, adjusts its parameters, and generalizes to make predictions on new data. Algorithms are the underlying procedures that guide the learning process and determine how a model is trained and updated.
",Distinguish between a Model and an Algorithm,"A “model” in machine learning is the output of a machine learning algorithm run on data.
A model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm.
The model is the “thing” that is saved after running a machine learning algorithm on training data and represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures required to make predictions   

While

An “algorithm” in machine learning is a procedure that is run on data to create a machine learning “model.”
Machine learning algorithms perform “pattern recognition.” Algorithms “learn” from data, or are “fit” on a dataset.	
Specifically, an algorithm is run on data to create a model.

3,"Cost estimation models are some mathematical algorithms or parametric equations that are used to estimate the cost of a product or a project. Various techniques or models are available for cost estimation, also known as Cost Estimation Models as shown below: Empirical Estimation Technique – Empirical estimation is a technique or model in which empirically derived formulas are used for predicting the data that are a required and essential part of the software project planning step. These techniques are usually based on the data that is collected previously from a project and also based on some guesses, prior experience with the development of similar types of projects, and assumptions. It uses the size of the software to estimate the effort. In this technique, an educated guess of project parameters is made. Hence, these models are based on common sense. However, as there are many activities involved in empirical estimation techniques, this technique is formalized. For example Delphi technique and Expert Judgement technique.
Heuristic Technique – Heuristic word is derived from a Greek word that means “to discover”. The heuristic technique is a technique or model that is used for solving problems, learning, or discovery in the practical methods which are used for achieving immediate goals. These techniques are flexible and simple for taking quick decisions through shortcuts and good enough calculations, most probably when working with complex data. But the decisions that are made using this technique are necessary to be optimal. In this technique, the relationship among different project parameters is expressed using mathematical equations. The popular heuristic technique is given by Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO). This technique is also used to increase or speed up the analysis and investment decisions.
Analytical Estimation Technique – Analytical estimation is a type of technique that is used to measure work. In this technique, firstly the task is divided or broken down into its basic component operations or elements for analyzing. Second, if the standard time is available from some other source, then these sources are applied to each element or component of work. Third, if there is no such time available, then the work is estimated based on the experience of the work. In this technique, results are derived by making certain basic assumptions about the project. Hence, the analytical estimation technique has some scientific basis. Halstead’s software science is based on an analytical estimation model.
Other Cost Estimation Models are:
Function Point Analysis (FPA): This technique counts the number and complexity of functions that a piece of software can perform to determine how functional and sophisticated it is. The effort needed for development, testing and maintenance can be estimated using this model.
Putnam Model: This model is a parametric estimation model that estimates effort, time and faults by taking into account the size of the the programme, the expertise of the development team and other project-specific characteristics.
Price-to-Win Estimation: Often utilized in competitive bidding, this model is concerned with projecting the expenses associated with developing a particular software project in order to secure a contract. It involves looking at market dynamics and competitors.
Models Based on Machine Learning: Custom cost estimating models can be built using machine learning techniques including neural networks, regression analysis and decision trees. These models are based on past project data. These models are flexible enough to adjust to changing data and project-specific features.

Features explanation
Object Oriented
Ruby is purely object-oriented programming language. Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. Every code has their properties and actions. Ruby is influenced with Smalltalk language. Rules applying to objects applies to the entire Ruby.

Flexibility
Ruby is a flexible language as you can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish.

Mixins
Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.

Dynamic typing and Duck typing
Ruby is a dynamic programming language. Ruby programs are not compiled. All class, module and method definition are built by the code when it run.

Ruby variables are loosely typed language, which means any variable can hold any type of object. When a method is called on an object, Ruby only looks up at the name irrespective of the type of object. This is duck typing. It allows you to make classes that pretend to be other classes.

Variable constants
In Ruby, constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.",List FIVE features of Ruby language and explain any THREE,"Ruby Features:

Features explanation
Object Oriented
Ruby is purely object-oriented programming language. Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. Every code has their properties and actions. Ruby is influenced with Smalltalk language. Rules applying to objects applies to the entire Ruby.

Flexibility
Ruby is a flexible language as you can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish.

Mixins
Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.

Dynamic typing and Duck typing
Ruby is a dynamic programming language. Ruby programs are not compiled. All class, module and method definition are built by the code when it run.

Ruby variables are loosely typed language, which means any variable can hold any type of object. When a method is called on an object, Ruby only looks up at the name irrespective of the type of object. This is duck typing. It allows you to make classes that pretend to be other classes.

Variable constants
In Ruby, constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.","Object Oriented

1.	Multi-paradigm language: It supports at least 7 different styles of programming
2.	General Purpose languages: It is used in developing, game, desktop, apps, operating systems etc.
3.	Speed: Performance is exceptional.
4.	Object-Oriented: It allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.
5.	Machine Independent: It is machine independent (it can be written on any operating system) but platform dependent (compiled on one operating system won’t run on another).
6.	Compiler-based: That is, C++ programs used to be compiled and their executed file is used to run it.
7.	Case sensitive
8.	Dynamic Memory Allocation: it allows us to allocate the memory of a variable or an array in run-time.
9.	Multithreading: it doesn’t contain any built-in support for multithreading applications, instead it relies entirely upon the os to supply this feature
10.	Mid-level programming languge: it is a programming languge that collects special features of high and low level language
11.	Rich Library: its library is full of in-built functions that save a huge amount of time in the software development phase. Hence, saves programming time and increase development speed.
12.	Recursion: Due to code reusability features, functions can be called within a function saving memory space by not rewriting codes.
Areas of applications
i.	Games: C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU intensive functions and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking. All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop the gaming systems as well as game development suites.
ii.	GUI Based application: C++ is used in developing desktop/GUI application e.g. Adobe, etc.
iii.	Database software: C++ is also used in written Database Management systems e.g. MySQL server
iv.	Operating System: C++ as a middle level language can be send in written an operating system, also because it is a strongly typed and fast programming language, it is ideal candidate for writing operating system.  e.g. Window OS, Linux OS
v.	Browser: Most browsers are written in C++ due to its fast performance e.g. Mozilla, Chrome, Tor etc.
vi.	Advanced Computation and graphics: C++ is useful in developing an application that requires high-performance image processing, real-time physical simulations, and mobile sensor applications that need high performance and speed. e.g. alias system
vii.	Banking Application: for banking applications that require multi-threading, concurrency, and high performance, C++ has been the best language due to it great performance. e.g. Infosys Finacle.
viii.	Cloud/Distributed system: C++ becomes a default choice for implementing such systems as it is close to the hardware and also provides multithreading support that can build concurrent applications and load tolerance.
ix.	Compilers: Compilers of various high-level programming languages are written in C++ because C++ is a middle-level language that is close to hardware and is able to program and manipulate the underlying hardware resources.
x.	Embedded system: Various embedded systems like smartwatches, medical equipment systems use C++ to program as it is closer to the hardware level and can provide a lot of low-level function calls when compared to the other high-level programming languages

1.	Multi-paradigm language: It supports at least 7 different styles of programming
2.	General Purpose languages: It is used in developing, game, desktop, apps, operating systems etc.
3.	Speed: Performance is exceptional.
4.	Object-Oriented: It allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.
5.	Machine Independent: It is machine independent (it can be written on any operating system) but platform dependent (compiled on one operating system won’t run on another).
6.	Compiler-based: That is, C++ programs used to be compiled and their executed file is used to run it.
7.	Case sensitive
8.	Dynamic Memory Allocation: it allows us to allocate the memory of a variable or an array in run-time.
9.	Multithreading: it doesn’t contain any built-in support for multithreading applications, instead it relies entirely upon the os to supply this feature
10.	Mid-level programming languge: it is a programming languge that collects special features of high and low level language
11.	Rich Library: its library is full of in-built functions that save a huge amount of time in the software development phase. Hence, saves programming time and increase development speed.
